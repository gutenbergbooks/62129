<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">This</span> is a spring day, and I am writing in a flood
of sunlight in front of a brown French inn. Above
my head there is the dusty branch of a tree stuck
out of a window, the ancient sign that gave
point to the proverb, 'Good wine needs no bush.'
Good books, I suppose, need no prefaces. But
honest authors realise that their books are never
as good as they had planned them. A preface,
put on last and worn in front, to show what they
would have liked their books to be, is the pleasantest
of their privileges. And I am not inclined to
do without it.</p>

<p>A book that calls itself a history of a subject
with as many byeways and blind alleys as exist
in the history of story-telling, is precisely the kind
of book that one would wish one's enemy to have
written. Everybody who reads it grumbles because
something or other is left out that, if they had
had the writing of it, would have been put in.
And yet in the case of this particular book (how
many authors have thought the same!) criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
of omissions is like quarrelling with a guinea-pig
because it has not got a tail. It is not the guinea-pig's
business to have a tail, and it is not the
business of this book to be a chronicle, full of facts,
and admirable for reference. That place is already
filled by Dunlop's <i>History of Fiction</i>, and, in
a very delightful manner, by Professor Raleigh's
<i>English Novel</i>. The word history can be used
in a different sense. The French say that such
an one makes a history of a thing when he makes
a great deal of talk about it. That is what I set
out to do. My business was not to be noting
down dates and facts&mdash;this book was published in
such a year and this in the year preceding. I was
to write with a livelier imp astride my pen. The
schoolmaster was to be sent to steal apples in the
orchard. I was to write of story-telling as a man
might write of painting or jewellery or any other
art he loved. I was to take here a book and there
a book, and notice the development of technique,
the conquests of new material, the gradual perfecting
of form. I would talk of old masters and
modern ones, and string my chapters like beads,
a space between each, along the history of the art.</p>

<p>Well, I have <i>fait une histoire</i>, suggested mainly
by the masterpieces that I love, and without too
much regard for those that happen to be loved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
other people. And now that it is done, I think
of it sadly enough. It should have been so
beautiful. When I see an old church, like the
priory church at Cartmel, standing grey and solemn
in the mist above the houses, or hear an old song,
like 'Summer is icumen in,' or see a browned
old picture, like Poussin's 'Bergers d'Arcadie,' I
feel that these things have meant more to man
than battles. These are his dreams and his ideals,
resting from age to age, long after the din of
fighting has died and been forgotten, recorded
each in its own way, in stone, in melody, in colour,
and in the tales also that, changing continually,
have 'held children from play and old men from
the chimney-corner,' the dreams lie hid. What
a tapestry they should have made. For the story
of this art, or indeed of any art, is the story of
man. Looking back through the years, as I sit
here and close my eyes against the sunlight, I see
the hard men and fierce women of the Sagas
living out their lives in the cold and vigorous
north&mdash;Pippin, the grandfather of Charlemagne,
sticking his sword indifferently through the devil,
Beaumains and his scornful lady riding through
the green wood. In the dungeon of the tower
sits Aucassin sorrowing for Nicolete his so sweet
friend. Among the orange-trees on the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
slope the gold-haired Fiammetta watches for her
lover. With battered armour and ascetic face
Don Quixote, upright in his saddle, rides on the
bare roads of Spain, dreaming of Dulcinea del
Toboso. Gil Blas swindles his way through life
and comes out top as an honest rascal will.
Clarissa sits in her chamber blotting with tears
her interminable correspondence. Tom Jones
draws blood from many meaner noses. My Uncle
Toby looks, not in the white, for the mote in the
Widow Wadman's eye. Mrs. Bennet begs her
husband, to 'come and make Lizzy marry Mr.
Collins.' Old Goriot pawns his plate and moves
to cheaper and yet cheaper rooms to keep his
daughters in their luxury. Raphael, nearing
death, watches the relentless shrinking of the morsel
of shagreen. There falls the House of Usher.
There floats the white face of Marie Roget down
the waters of the Seine. Quasimodo leers through
the rosace; Mateo Falcone feels the earth with
the butt of his gun and finds it not too hard for the
digging of a child's grave; Clarimonde throws her
passionate regard across the cathedral to the young
novice about to take his vows; and, with a clatter
of hoofs, the musketeers ride off for the reputation
of the Queen of France.</p>

<p>A tapestry indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>

I turn over my chapters, torn rags of colour
loosely patched together, and then look back to
my dream, that gorgeous thing that for these five
years past has glittered and swung before me. I
look from one to the other and back again, and
am almost ready to tear up the book in order to
regain the delightful possession of the dream. It
was a task to be taken up reverently and with
love; and indeed these are the only qualifications
I can honestly claim. But it needed far more.
Now that I have done my best, I look at the
result and am afraid. I hate, like I hate the
tourists in Notre Dame, impertinent little
books on splendid subjects. With my heart in
my mouth I ask myself if I have made one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Impertinent or no, my book is very vulnerable,
and since it is my own I must defend it, so far as
that is possible, by defining my intentions. The
chapters are, as I meant them be, threaded like
beads along the history of the art, and it is very
easy to quarrel not only with the beads, but also
with the spaces between them. There is no one
who reads the book who will not find somewhere
a space where he would have had a gleaming bead,
a bead, where he would have had a contemptuous
space. I could not put everything in; but have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
left material for many complementary volumes.
It would perhaps be possible, writing only of
authors I have not considered, to produce a
history of story-telling no more incomplete than
this. But it will be found, and the fact is perhaps
my justification, that few of my omissions have
been made by accident. In order to have the
satisfaction of coming to an end at all, I had to
seek the closest limits, and those limits, once
chosen, barred, to my own surprise, more than one
great story-teller from any detailed discussion.</p>

<p>My object not being an expanded bibliography
of story-telling, but rather a series of chapters that
would trace the development of the art, many
admirable writers, who were content with the
moulds that were ready made to their hands, fell
outside my range, however noble, however human
was the material they poured into the ancient
matrices. Dickens and Thackeray, for example,
pouring their energy and feeling and wit and
humour into the moulds designed by the
eighteenth century, had, economically, to be
passed over, since across the channel and in
America men were writing stories, not necessarily
greater, nor of wider appeal to mankind, but of
more vital interest to their fellow artists.
Throughout the book we hunt, my readers and I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
with the hare. Always we discuss the art in those
examples that seem the most advanced of their time.
Just as with the Romantic movement I pass over
from England to France, though the book contains
no survey of French fiction, so when Cervantes
is the leading story-teller, the artist nearest our
own time, I shall be in Spain, though Spanish
literature does not make a continuous thread in
the history. I shall think more of the art than of
my own country, or indeed of any country, and
shall neglect all literatures in turn when they
are producing nothing that is memorable in the
progress of the technique of story-telling, however
freely they may be contributing great or brilliant
tales to the world's resources of amusement.</p>

<p>Then too, it will be noticed that I neglect my
opportunities. What a semblance of erudition I
might have made by discussing, among the origins
of story-telling, the Greek and Latin specimens of
narrative. But it seemed desirable, since it was
possible, to trace the development of the art
entirely in the literatures of our own civilisation.
French and English, the two greatest European
literatures, contain, grafted on their national
stocks, every flower of the art that was cultivated
by Greece or Rome. I have used for discussion
only the books known and made by our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
ancestors, and when, at the Renaissance, they
lifted forms out of Antiquity and filled them with
imitations of classical matter, I have considered
the imitations rather than the originals, if only
because any further influence they may have had
on the development of the art was exerted not
by the classical writers but by the Englishmen,
Frenchmen, Spaniards, and Italians who made
their manners and materials their own.</p>

<p>The book represents many years of reading, and
two of writing where it should have taken ten. It
has travelled about with me piecemeal, and, if I
dated my chapters from the places where I wrote
them, they would trace a very various itinerary.
In France, in England, and in Scotland it has
shared my adventures, and indeed it is a wilful,
rambling thing, more than a little reminiscent of
its infancy. Do not expect it to be too consistent.
There is, I fear, no need for me to ask
you not to read it all at once.</p>

<h3>ORIGINS</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Story-telling
outside
books.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Story-telling</span> has nowadays only a shamefaced
existence outside books. We leave the art to the
artist, perhaps because he has brought it to such
perfection that we do not care to expose our
amateur bunglings. If a man has a story to tell
after dinner he carefully puts it into slang, or
tells it with jerk and gesture in as few words
as possible; it is as if he were to hold up a little
placard deprecating the idea that he is telling a
story at all. The only tales in which we allow
ourselves much detail of colouring and background
are those in which public opinion has
prohibited professional competition. We tell improper
stories as competently as ever. But, for
the other tales, we set them out concisely, almost
curtly, refusing any attempt to imitate the fuller,
richer treatment of literature. Our tales are mere
plots. We allow ourselves scarcely two sentences
of dialogue to clinch them at the finish. We give
them no framework. We are shy, except perhaps
before a single intimate friend, of trying in a
spoken story to reproduce the effect of moonlight
in the trees, the flickering firelight on the faces in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a tavern, or whatever else of delicacy and embroidery
we should be glad to use in writing.</p>

<p>But in the beginning story-telling was not an
affair of pen and ink. It began with the Warning
Examples naturally told by a mother to her
children, and with the Embroidered Exploits told
by a boaster to his wife or friends. The early
woman would persuade her child from the fire with
a tale of how just such another as he had touched
the yellow dancer, and had had his hair burned
and his eyelashes singed so that he could not look
in the face of the sun. Enjoying the narrative,
she would give it realistic and credible touches,
and so make something more of it than the dull
lie of utility. The early man, fresh from an encounter
with some beast of the woods, would not
be so little of an artist as to tell the actual facts;
how he heard a noise, the creaking of boughs and
crackling in the undergrowth, and ran. No; he
would describe the monster, sketch his panic
moments, the short, fierce struggle, his stratagem,
and his escape. In these two primitive tales, and
their combination in varying proportions, are the
germs of all the others. There is no story written
to-day which cannot trace its pedigree to those
two primitive types of narrative, generated by the
vanity of man and the exigencies of his life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
professional
story-teller.</div>

<p>At first there would be no professional story-tellers.
But it would not be long before, by
the camp fire, in the desert tents, and in the huts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
at night, wherever simple men were together
relating the experiences of vigorous days, there
would be found some one whose adventures were
always the pleasantest to hear, whose deeds were
the most marvellous, whose realistic details the
most varied. Probably it would also be found that
this same man could also give the neatest point to
the tales of wisdom that were the children of the
Warning Example. Men would begin to quote
his stories, and gradually the discrepancy between
his life and the life that he lived as he recounted
it to his nightly audiences would grow too great
to be ignored. His adventures would become too
tremendous for himself, and, to save his modesty
and preserve his credit, he would father them
upon some dead chief, a strong man who had done
things that others had not, and, being dead, was
unable to contradict with his stone axe his too
enthusiastic biographer. Such a man, like many
a modern story-teller, would likely use his hold
over the imagination of his fellows to become the
medicine man of his tribe, the depositary of their
traditions, their sage as well as their entertainer.
He would create gods besides rebuilding men,
and while his people were sheltering in the huts
and listening atremble to the dying rolls of the
thunder, would describe how his hero, the dead
chief of long ago, was even now wrestling with
the Thunder God and getting his knee upon that
mighty throat. In the beginning man was a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
little thing in the face of a stupendous Universe.
Story-telling raised him higher and higher until at
last heaven and earth were hidden by the gigantic
figure of a man. In the Arthur legend, in the
legend of Charlemagne, in the Sagas, we can
watch men becoming heroes, and heroes supernatural.
Then story-telling, having done so
much, was to set to work in the opposite direction,
and we shall see the figures of men gradually
shrinking into their true proportions through each
successive phase of the art, until, now that we
have examples of all stages permanently before us,
we manufacture gods, heroes, men, and creatures
less than men, with almost equal profusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In early
story-telling
heroes are
more than
life size.</div>

<p>But in the beginning of written story-telling,
when life was a huge battle in which it was the
proper thing to die, when the heroes of stories
were not finished off with marriage but by the
more definite means of a battle-axe, when life was
a thing of such swiftness, fierceness, and force, it
was clear to his biographer that the creature who
conquered it was surely more than man. His
were the attributes of the gods, with whom he
was not frightened to struggle or to be allied.
Sigurd's pedigree is carried back to Odin. Pippin
struck a sword through the devil who met him as
he went to bath, and found that 'the shape was
so far material that it defiled all those waters with
blood and gore and horrid slime. Even this did
not upset the unconquerable Pippin. He said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
his chamberlain: "Do not mind this little affair.
Let the defiled water run for a while; and then,
when it flows clear again, I will take my bath
without delay."' Beowulf fought with dragons
and died boasting gloriously. Theirs are the
figures of men a thousand times man's height,
very man-like, but gigantic, like the watchers
shadowed on the mountain mist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Silk and
homespun
stories.</div>

<p>Each nation showed its peculiar spirit in huge
cycles of narrative. The solid force of the Vikings
and their sword-bright imagery survives in the
Sagas; the French chivalry in the legends of
Charlemagne and Arthur; the Celtic feeling for
the veiled things in the spells and dreams of the
<i>Mabinogion</i>. These were the great stories of their
peoples. But side by side with them were others.
The thralls of the Vikings heard of Brunhild and
Gudrun, the serfs of France heard of Roland and
Bertha with the Large Feet; but they had also tales
of their own. The tales of silk have been preserved
for us in writing, but what of the tales of homespun
yarn that no old clerk thought worthy of a
manuscript with gold leaves, and sweet faces, and
blue and scarlet flowers entwined around its
borders?</p>

<p>Very few of these homespun stories were
written down. <i>Reynard the Fox</i> had few
brethren except in spoken story-telling. Perhaps
just because they never were written down, we
can guess from the folk-lore that has survived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
among us to our own day, and from the tales we
hear from savages, what were those tales of Jean
and Jaques, that were perhaps nearer modern story-telling
than the great books that were known by
their masters. In folk-tale, as in <i>Reynard the
Fox</i>, we find very different virtues from those of
the knights, heroes, kings, and gods. In the
silken tales the virtues are those of Don Quixote;
in the homespun stories they are those of Sancho
Panza. Chivalry would seem an old conceit;
bravery, foolhardiness. Sagacity, cunning, and
mischief are their motives. In the silken tales
there is no scorn shown save of cowards, in the
folk-tales none save of fools. Perhaps the proverbs
illustrate them best. 'Do not close the
stable door after the horse has gone.' 'A stitch
in time saves nine.' 'A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush.' These are all short stories
summed in a sentence, and any one of them
might serve as the motive of a modern novel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
swineherd
and the
king's
daughter.</div>

<p>From the time that stories began to be written
down, we can watch them coming nearer and
nearer to this level, nearer and nearer the ordinary
man. The history of story-telling henceforth is
that of the abasement of the grand and the
uplifting of the lowly, and of the mingling of
the two. The folk-tale of the swineherd who
married the king's daughter is the history alike
of the progress of humanity and of the materials
of story-telling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reduction
in the size of
the heroes.</div>

<p>But before the heroes of written story-telling
could begin to be humble, they had to leave off
being gods. It is possible to observe the transformation
by comparing a set of early stories
composed at practically the same time, but in
different countries, in different stages of civilisation,
and so, for the purpose of our argument, in
sequence. The <i>Volsunga Saga</i>, the <i>Mabinogion</i>
and <i>Aucassin and Nicolete</i> were all composed
about the same time, but there are centuries of
development between them. The heroes of the
sagas are 'too largely thewed for life'; Aucassin
is a boy. Love in the sagas is a fierce passion,
the mainspring of terrific deeds; Aucassin's love
is a tender obsession that keeps him from his
arms, and lets him ride, careless and dreaming,
into the midst of his enemies. In the <i>Morte
Darthur</i>, as we have it in Malory's version of
the much older tales, we can see the two spirits
pulling at cross purposes in the same book.
Beneath there is the rugged brutality of the old
fighting tales, overlaid now with the softer texture
of chivalry and gentleness. The one shows
through the other like the grey rock through the
green turf of our north country fields.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Technique
of the Sagas.</div>

<p>The technique of the old tales varies most
precisely with the humanity and loss of super-humanity
of their heroes. In the sagas it is very
simple. The effect is got by sheer weight and
mass of magnificent human material. The details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
are those of personal appearance and armour; there
are no settings. The men ride out gorgeous and
bright in battle array, with gold about their helms,
and painted shields, on great white horses against
a sombre sky. There is no other background to
the tales than heaven and the watchful gods. It
was not until a later stage in their development
that story-tellers painted their full canvas, and
put in woodland and castle and all those other
accessories that force their human figures to a
human height. At first, like the early painters,
they were content with the outlines of men doing
things; their audiences, with unspoilt imaginations,
filled in the rest themselves. Then, too, they told
their tales in a short sing-song form of verse that
served well to keep them in mind, but prevented
any great variation in emphasis. A lament for the
dead warrior, a p&aelig;an for his victory, and an account
of his wife's beauty, a genealogical tree, were all
forced to jog to the same tune, and the atmosphere
and scent of their telling could only be altered by
the intonations of the singer. They still depended
for their effect on the men who recited them, and
had not achieved the completeness of expression
that would give them independence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of the <i>Mabinogion</i>.</div>

<p>The <i>Mabinogion</i>, that took literary form at
about the same time, were made by a Celtic
nation, far further advanced as artists than the
Scandinavians. The men are not so great in
their biographers' eyes as to hide all else. Picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
after picture is made and left as the tale goes on.
For example:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'And at the mouth of the river he beheld a castle, the
fairest that man ever saw, and the gate of the castle was
open, and he went into the castle. And in the castle he
saw a fair hall, of which the roof seemed to be all gold;
the walls of the hall seemed to be entirely of glittering
precious gems; the doors all seemed to be of gold. Golden
seats he saw in the hall, and silver tables. And on a seat
opposite to him he beheld two auburn-haired youths playing
at chess. He saw a silver board for the chess, and
golden pieces thereon. The garments of the youths were
of jet black satin, and chaplets of ruddy gold bound their
hair, whereon were sparkling jewels of great price, rubies,
and gems, alternately with imperial stones. Buskins of
new Cordovan leather on their feet, fastened by slides of
red gold.</p>

<p>'And beside a pillar in the hall he saw a hoary-headed
man, in a chair of ivory, with the figures of two eagles of
ruddy gold thereon. Bracelets of gold were upon his arms,
and many rings were on his hands, and a golden torque
about his neck; and his hair was bound with a golden
diadem. He was of powerful aspect. A chessboard of
gold was before him and a rod of gold, and a steel file in
his hand. And he was carving out chessmen.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These two paragraphs are almost perfect in their
kind. See only how the details are presented in a
perfectly natural order, each one as it would strike
a man advancing into the hall, who would see
everything before discovering exactly what the
old man was about with his chessboard, his gold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>and his steel file.
The Welsh bards were trained
more rigorously than the skalds, and were more
delicate in their craftsmanship. And yet it is
interesting to see how these two paragraphs are
the work of a man writing for people in whose
eyes gold and ivory and precious stones have still
the glory of the new. The feeling of that little
piece of story is the same we know ourselves when
we have a little child before us, and are telling it
wonderful things to make it open its eyes. The
opening of eyes was one of the effects at which
the early artists aimed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of <i>Aucassin
and
Nicolete</i>.</div>

<p>And then when we come to <i>Aucassin and
Nicolete</i>, also written at the same time, but in a
country still less barbaric, we find an even more
delicate artistry, and a material far nearer that of
later story-telling. Not only have the heroes
become men, but the wondrous background has
become that of real life. There are no castles in
<i>Aucassin and Nicolete</i> whose walls are built 'of
precious gems, whose doors are all of gold.'
Nicolete 'went through the streets of Beaucaire
keeping to the shadow, for the moon shone very
bright; and she went on till she came to the tower
where her friend was. The tower had cracks in it
here and there, and she crouched against one of
the piers, and wrapped herself in her mantle, and
thrust her head into a chink in the tower, which
was old and ancient, and heard Aucassin within
weeping, and making very great sorrow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lamenting for his sweet friend whom he loved so
much.' Now that is a real tower, as we see again
when presently Nicolete has to go along its wall,
and let herself down into the ditch, hurting her
feet sorely before climbing out on the other side.
And is not that an admirable sense for reality
that suggested the keeping to the shadow as she
crept through the town? As for the humanity of
the tale; we have been smitten to awe and worship
by the heroes of the sagas, interested in the heroes
of the magic-laden Mabinogion, and now we are
made to be sorry for Aucassin. Like the swing
of a pendulum, the character of heroes has swung
from that of God-like ruffians, through that of men,
almost to womanhood. We have had terrible
tales, and wondrous tales, and now</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'There is none in such ill case,</div>

<div class="i0">Whole again and glad with glee,</div>
<div class="i2">So <i>sweet</i> the story.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Loveliness and delicacy are here for their own
sakes. We have already passed the early stages
of narrative. We are in the time of sweetly
patterned art; in the monastery over in England
a monk is writing the air of 'Summer is icumen
in,' the first known piece of finished, ordered
music; everywhere clerks and holy men, aloof a
little from the turmoil of life, are making gardens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in the margins of missals, and on the roads
throughout the world the vagabond students,
as separate from the turmoil as the monks,
are singing the Latin songs that promised the
Renaissance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h3>'THE ROMANCE OF THE ROSE'</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The
thirteenth
century.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Thinking</span> of the Renaissance now, we are apt to
see only the flowers of its spring, the work of
men like Boccaccio and Chaucer, who were strong
enough and aloof enough to lift their heads above
the flood of classical learning that refreshed them,
and to write as blithely as if there had been never
a book in the world before them. It is easy to
forget those dull years after Chaucer that showed
how exceptional he had been in being at once a
student and an artist. It is still easier to forget
the winter years of ploughing and sowing and premature
birth that were before him, the years when
no one thought that poetry could be more esteemed
than knowledge, those greedy years of rough and
ready erudition between the making of the students'
songs and the building of the <i>Decameron</i>. Many
versions of old legends come to us from that time
like the <i>Life of Robert the Devil</i>, whose son
fought with Charlemagne. Many of the legends
of the kind that the son of Mr. Bickerstaff's friend
was such a proficient in, and many collections
of miracles and small romances of chivalry less
beautiful than that of Aucassin, were at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
written down in these years. The monasteries
held most of the learned men, and became more
important than the minstrels in the history of
story-telling. They produced the books of
miracles, and also several armouries of warning
examples, many of them taken from the classics,
for the vanquishing of scrupulous sinners and the
edification of all. Books like the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>,
volumes of tales more or less irrelevantly
tagged with morals, were the forerunners of
collections of less instructive stories, like those
of Boccaccio's country-house party, or those of
Chaucer's pilgrims riding to Canterbury. These
books, with their frequent reference to antiquity,
showed signs of the new spirit that was spreading
over Europe; the miracle-tales and the exaggerated
wondering biographies held the essence of the old.
Rome in the former was the city built by Romulus
and Remus; Rome in the latter was the place that
had been rescued by Charlemagne, the place that
was ruled by the Pope.</p>

<p>But in that thirteenth century, when so many
new things were struggling to birth, one book
stands out above all others as the most perfect
illustration of its spirit. The very fact that it is
so much less of a story than the anecdotes of
the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> had almost made me pass
it over in a more detailed criticism of them, but
this same fact perfects it as an example of an
artist's attitude in the time of the revival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
classical learning. It was almost an accident that
let me see these years of novel study and eager
wisdom so clearly expressed in the long rhyming
narrative of the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>, that was
known above all other books for a hundred years,
that was read by Ronsard, modernised by Marot,
and partly translated by Chaucer. The accident
was such that I think there is no irrelevance in
describing it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meung-sur-Loire.</div>

<p>Walking through France with the manuscript
of my history on my back, I came at evening of
an April day into the little grey French town of
Meung, set on the side of a hill above the Loire.
Small cobbled streets twisted this way and that,
up and down, between the old houses, and walking
under the gateway, the Porte d'Amont, with
its low arch and narrow windows overhead, I felt
I was stepping suddenly from the broad, practical
France, whose roadside crucifixes are made of
iron a hundred at a time, into a forgotten corner
of that older France whose spirit clings about the
new, like the breath of lavender in a room where
it has once been kept. In the inn where I left
my knapsack there was a miller who drank a
bottle of wine with me, and talked of old Jean
Clopinel, who was born here in Meung those
centuries ago. 'And it was a big book he had
the writing of too, and a wise book, so they tell
me, and good poetry; but it's written in the old
French that's not our language any longer; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
could not read it if I tried, and why should I?
They know all about it in the town.'</p>

<p>Indeed the town seemed a piece of the old
French itself, with its partly ruined church, and
the little ch&acirc;teau crowned with conical cap-like
towers, the broad Loire flowing below. I thought
of <i>The Romance of the Rose</i>, Jean Clopinel's book,
the book that meant so much to the Middle Ages,
the book that, unwieldy as it is, is still deliciously
alive. I thought of Jean Clopinel and his description
of himself, put as a prophecy into the mouth
of the God of Love:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'Then shall appear Jean Clopinel,</div>
<div class="i0">Joyous of heart, of body well</div>
<div class="i0">And fairly built: at Meun shall he</div>
<div class="i0">Be born where Loire flows peacefully.'<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">I made up my mind to look at the old book again
when I should have left the road, and be within
reach of a larger library than my own manuscript
and a single volume of Defoe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jean de
Meung.</div>

<p>Jean de Meung, joyous of heart, belongs
absolutely to the medi&aelig;val revival of learning.
He was less of a poet than a scholar, more pleased
with a display of knowledge than of beauty, and
yet so far undamped by his learning as to be
always ready to put plainly out such observations
upon life as keep a reader smiling to-day at their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>shrewdness and applicability. His share of <i>The
Romance of the Rose</i> is a strange and suggestive
contrast with the beginning that was written by
Guillaume de Lorris. The first part, earlier by
forty years than the second, and about a fifth of the
length, is a delicious allegory on love, with the
sweetness and purity of <i>Aucassin and Nicolete</i>;
the second opens solidly with a good round speech
by Reason, filling something like two thousand
lines, and ransacking antiquity to fit her wise saws
with ancient instances according to the new
fashion of the time.</p>

<p>Taine finds this garrulous Jean 'the most tedious
of doctors'; but it is difficult not to throw yourself
into his own delight in his new-won knowledge,
hard not to enjoy his continual little
revelations of character, as when you read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'Let one demand of some wise clerk</div>
<div class="i0">Well versed in that most noble work</div>
<div class="i0">"Of Consolation" foretime writ</div>
<div class="i0">By great Boethius, for in it</div>
<div class="i0">Are stored and hidden most profound</div>
<div class="i0">And learned lessons: 'twould redound</div>
<div class="i0">Greatly to that man's praise who should</div>
<div class="i0">Translate that book with masterhood,'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">and know that he made the translation himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The world
at school.</div>

<p>The very popularity of the book proves that the
whole world was at school then, and eager to be
taught. Lorris, poet though he is, reminds his
readers that his embroidered tale hides something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
really valuable, that it is 'fair wit with wisdom
closely wed,' knowing well that he could find no
better bait to keep them with him to the end.
And Jean, when it comes to his turn, admirably
expresses the contemporary point of view. He
has no doubts at all between the comparative
worths of manner and matter. He justifies the
classics by saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'For oft their quip and crank and fable</div>
<div class="i0">Is wondrous good and profitable.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">One of the
schoolmasters.</div>

<p class="noin">The permanent value of knowledge is always
before him, and having learnt a great deal himself,
what wonder that he should empty it all out,
only now and again giving the tale a perfunctory
prod forward before continuing his discourse?
Knowledge comes always before culture, and
knowledge taken with such abandon is almost
inspiriting. I cannot be bored by a scholar who
in the thirteenth century is so independent and so
frank. Eager quarry work such as his had to
precede the refined statuary of the Renaissance,
and in <i>The Romance of the Rose</i> the pedagogue
is far too human to be dismissed as a dealer in
books alone. Wisdom and observation were not
disunited in him, and there are in that rambling,
various repository of learning promises enough of
realistic story-telling and of the criticism of life,
sufficiently valuable to excuse its atrocious narrative,
even were that not justified by the classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
allusion with which it is so abundantly loaded. It
gives me pleasure to hear Jean Clopinel defend
plain speaking, and, protesting against calling
spades anything but spades, prepare the way for
Rabelais. What matter if the romance suffer a
little, and the Rose lie pressed beneath a weight
of scholarship? Jean himself moves on unhampered.
He talked of women's table-manners
so well that Chaucer himself could do no better
than borrow from him. He attacked womenkind
in general so mercilessly (with the authority of the
classics behind him) that he won a stern rebuke
from Christine de Pisan, that popular authoress of
a century later, just as Schopenhauer might be
censured by Miss Corelli. He looks at kings, and,
turning away, remarks that it is best, if a man
wishes to feel respectful towards them, that he
should not see them too close. Nor does he forget
to let us know his views on astronomy, on
immortality, or his preference of nature over art
in sculpture and painting. This last opinion of
his is an illustration of that good and honest
Philistinism that he needed for his work. All
these things and a thousand others he puts, without
a shudder, into the continuation of a story on
the art of loving, that begins with a spring morning
account of a dreamer's vision of a rose and
a garden, and Mirth and Idleness, Youth and
Courtesy, dancing together as if in a picture by
Botticelli.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">In Meung
six hundred
years ago.</div>

<p>I went down that night just after sunset and
crossed the river in the dusk. Resting in the
middle of the bridge and looking over the dim
reflections to the far-distant bank, with its grove
of huge trees, and the tower of the church with
the outline of the gateway on the hill behind just
showing against the sky, I dreamed that I was
back in the old days, when the minstrel was
giving place to the scholar, and that up there on
the hill, in the little town of Meung, was Jean,
Doctor of Divinity, poring at his books. I
remembered the bust by Desvergnes, that beautiful
scholar's face, and thought how strong a personality
his must have been, to leave after six
hundred years and more the memory of himself
and the feeling of his time so vividly impressed
upon the town. For even now, though they do
not read his book in Meung, they know all about
it, and talk of him with that reverence in speaking
that children use when they talk of a master
whom they do not often see. I could not help
feeling that their attitude was traditional. It has
been the same for all these years, and perhaps
long ago the townsfolk, passing in the narrow

<p class="noin">these tales, whether made by the 'olde gentil
Britons' or the French, must not be forgotten in
considering him.</p>

<p>The romancers who preceded him, and, clad in
bright colours, chanted their stories before the
ladies and knights in the rush-carpeted halls, turning
somersaults between their chapters, as many a
modern novelist might for the enlivenment of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
narrative, were not scholars, but had great store
of legendary matter from which they made their
tales. Their material continued to be used,
more and more elaborately, until the time of
Cervantes, and in such books as the <i>Morte
Darthur</i> we can see what manner of material it
was. They were not in the least afraid of the
supernatural, and they knew the undying attraction
of hard blows. Their tales were compiled
without reference to the classics, and contain all
the characteristics of primitive story-telling noted
in the chapter on Origins. They represented,
fairly accurately, the Embroidered Exploit.
They were tales of heroes, knights, and kings,
half elfin stuff, half history, elaborate genealogical
narratives in which the sins of the fathers are
visited upon the children, and the grandsons'
misfortunes are connected with their parents'
revenge on the previous generation. There were
great dragon-slayers before the Lord, and many
who, like Charlemagne, were mighty killers of
Saracens in the cause of Christendom. And then
there were such tales as that of Melusine, whose
father, King Helymas, married a fairy, and out of
love for her broke his promise not to inquire how
she was when she lay in childbed. Melusine
suffers accordingly, spending every Saturday
bathing herself, with her delicate white limbs
hidden beneath a serpent's scaly skin. There
comes to her a young knight called Raymondin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
whom she saves by her wisdom, enriches by her
magic, weds with great pomp, and presents in
successive years with ten sons, each curiously deformed
by reason of the fairy blood. Raymondin,
in espousing her, promises to make no inquiries
about her doings on Saturdays. He breaks his
promise, like his father-in-law before him, and
when, in anger at the ill-deeds of one of his sons,
he reproaches her with what she is, she sadly
takes leave of him, and flies off through the
window, 'transfigured lyke a serpent grete and
long in fifteen foote of lengthe.' There were
tales too of more charming fancy, like that of the
queen who bore seven children at a birth, six
boys and a girl, with silver chains about their
necks. The midwife, in her devilish way, showed
her seven puppies with silver collars instead of
her litter of babes, privately sending the children
to be killed. The children, however, left in the
forest, were nurtured by a nanny-goat and cared
for by a hermit, until the midwife discovered that
they were not dead, when she sent men to see
that they were properly scotched. But the men
were so softened by the accident of meeting a
crowd busied with the burning of a woman who
had killed her child, that they had only heart to
take the chains from off the babies' necks, whereupon
they flew away as white swans. That is the
beginning of the tale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The <i>Gesta
Romanorum.</i></div>

<p>There were tales like these representing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Embroidered Exploit, and there were others
illustrating in a curious manner the growth of
the Warning Example. These latter were the
forerunners of the tales of Boccaccio, who, like
Chaucer, stands as it were with a Janus-head,
looking both ways, modern and primitive at once.
The <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> is a perfectly delightful
book, whose purpose was, however, not pleasure
but edification. It is a collection of stories containing
amusement and religion, diversion and
instruction&mdash;a primrose path from the everlasting
bonfire. The anecdotes are from a thousand
sources. Many of them are taken from the
classics, but the references are so inaccurate as to
make it pretty certain that the monkish writer had
not read them, but had gleaned them from the
conversation of other monks he knew. And some
of them cannot have come to him within the
monastery. I can imagine the old man, with his
hood well thrown back, lolling on a bench, behind
a tankard of good wine and a dish of fruit, laughing
gleefully at the tale of the rich patroness or
pious knight who wished to entertain themselves
and him. For almost the only things monkish
about the stories are the applications or morals,
some of which are so far fetched as to make it
clear that the monk compiler has included a tale
for the pleasure he has himself won from it, and,
after writing it down, been hard put to it to find
a moral that should justify its place in a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
intended as an armoury for preachers. Here is an
example:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>'OF THE AVARICIOUS PURSUIT OF RICHES, WHICH
LEADS TO HELL.'</h4>

<p>'A certain carpenter, residing in a city near the sea, very
covetous and very wicked, collected a large sum of money,
and placed it in the trunk of a tree, which he stationed by
his fireside, and which he never lost sight of. A place like
this, he thought, no one could suspect; but it happened,
that while all his household slept, the sea overflowed its
boundaries, broke down that side of the building where the
log was situated, and carried it away. It floated many
miles from its original destination, and reached at length a
city in which there lived a person who kept open house.
Arising early in the morning, he perceived the trunk of a
tree in the water, and thinking it would be of service to
him, he brought it to his own home. He was a liberal,
kind-hearted man, and a great benefactor to the poor. It
one day chanced that he entertained some pilgrims in his
house; and the weather being extremely cold, he cut up
the log for firewood. When he had struck two or three
blows with the axe, he heard a rattling sound; and cleaving
it in twain, the gold pieces rolled out in every direction.
Greatly rejoiced at the discovery, he reposited them in a
secure place, until he should ascertain who was the owner.</p>

<p>'Now the carpenter, bitterly lamenting the loss of his
money, travelled from place to place in pursuit of it. He
came, by accident, to the house of the hospitable man who
had found the trunk. He failed not to mention the object
of his search; and the host, understanding that the money
was his, reflected whether his title to it were good. "I
will prove," said he to himself, "if God will that the money
should be returned to him." Accordingly he made three
cakes, the first of which he filled with earth, the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>with the bones of dead men, and in the third he put a
quantity of the gold which he had discovered in the trunk.
"Friend," said he, addressing the carpenter, "we will eat
three cakes, composed of the best meat in my house. Chuse
which you will have." The carpenter did as he was
directed, he took the cakes and weighed them in his hand,
one after another, and finding that the earth weighed
heaviest, he chose it. "And if I want more, my worthy
host," added he, "I will have that"&mdash;laying his hand upon
the cake containing the bones. "You may keep the third
cake yourself." "I see clearly," murmured the host, "I
see very clearly that God does not will the money to be
returned to this wretched man." Calling, therefore, the
poor and infirm, the blind and the lame, and opening the
cake of gold in the presence of the carpenter, to whom he
spoke, "Thou miserable varlet, this is thine own gold.
But thou preferredst the cake of earth and dead men's
bones. I am persuaded, therefore, that God wills not that
I return thee thy money." Without delay, he distributed
the whole among the paupers, and drove the carpenter
away in great tribulation.'</p></blockquote>

<p>So much for the story, which is indeed rather
long to be quoted in so small a book. But listen
now to the application:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'My beloved, the carpenter is any worldly-minded man;
the trunk of the tree denotes the human heart, filled with
the riches of this life. The host is a wise confessor. The
cake of earth is the world; that of the bones of dead men
is the flesh; and that of gold is the kingdom of heaven.'</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Chaucer and
Boccaccio.</div>

<p>The modern novel could have no beginning in a
literature so far removed from ordinary life as the
romances, so brief in narration, so pious in ideal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
as the Gesta. Something more of flesh and blood,
something of coarser grain than dreams, on the
one hand, and on the other something fuller
fleshed than the skeletonic anecdote (however
marrowy its bones) was needed to produce it. It
needed men and women, and it needed a more
delicate narrative form, portraiture, and the fine
art of story-telling, Chaucer, and Boccaccio.
Chaucer, for all that he wrote in verse, was not
a <i>trouveur</i> when he was at his best. Boccaccio
was not a collector of anecdotes. The new
classical learning had given them humaner outlooks.
The attitude of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> is
not that of the <i>Song of Roland</i>, or the <i>Morte
Darthur</i>; the attitude of the <i>Decameron</i> is not
that of the Gesta. Chaucer and Boccaccio, sometimes
at least, were plain men, pleasantly conscious
of their humanity, telling stories to amuse their
friends.</p>

<p>Chaucer was a middle-class Englishman,
Boccaccio a middle-class Italian. They both
wrote in languages that were scarcely older than
themselves, in languages that were rather popular
than learned. They were both in a sense mediators
between the classical culture and their own
people. There the resemblance ends, and their
personal characters begin to seal the impressions
they made on their respective literatures. They
represent two quite distinct advances in the art of
story-telling, the one in material, the other in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
technique. In both of them there is a personal
honesty of workmanship that makes their work
their own. The names of the <i>trouveurs</i> are lost,
or, at least, not connected with what they did.
They were workers on a general theme, and
counted no more in the production of the whole
than the thousand men who chiselled out each
his piece of carving round the arches of Notre
Dame. They were the tools of their nations.
Chaucer and Boccaccio were men whose workmanship
had its special marks, its private personality.
They were artists in their own right and not
artisans.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Chaucer.</div>

<p>Chaucer's was a fairly simple nature. He seems
to have taken to Renaissance fashions just as he
took to Renaissance learning, without in the least
disturbing the solid Englishness of his foundation.
He married a Damsell Philippa without letting his
marriage interfere with an ideal and unrequited
passion like that of Petrarch for Laura. He had
Jean de Meung's own reverence for the classics.
'Go litel book, go litel my tragedie,' he says in
'<i>Troilus and Criseyd</i>,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'And kiss the steppes, wher-as thou seest pace</div>
<div class="i0">Virgil, Ovyde, Omer, Lucan, and Stace.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">And yet few men have about them less of a
classical savour. He may well have liked 'at

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="noin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
but he was a man of the true 'Merry England,'
when oxen were roasted whole on feast-days, and
pigs ran in the London streets. He followed the
Court, but he knew the populace. His father
was a vintner in Thames Street, and in the Cheapside
taverns Chaucer found some of the material
that his travels and learning taught him how to
use. On St. George's day 1374 he was granted
a pitcher of wine daily for life by his Majesty
Edward the Third. It is probable that he met
Petrarch at Padua. These two facts seem to me
to present no very hollow portrait of the man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portraiture.</div>

<p>He brought into the art of story-telling a new
clearness of sight in looking at other people and at
the manners of the time. The romances had not
represented contemporary life, but rather contemporary
ideals. No one can pretend to find in
Lancelot, in Roland, in Isoud of the White
Hands, character-sketch or portrait. Lancelot is
the perfect knight, Roland the perfect warrior,
Isoud the beautiful woman. They were not a
knight, a warrior, a woman. Those who heard the
tales used the names as servant-girls use names
in modern novels of plot, as pegs on which to
hang their own emotions and their own ambitions.
The lady who listened with her chin upon her
hands as the <i>trouveurs</i> chanted before her, took
herself the part of Isoud, and gave her lover or
the lover for whom she hoped the attributes of
Tristram. The jack-squire listening near the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the table himself felt Roland's steed between
his legs. These names of romance were qualities
not people. The Wife of Bath is a very different
matter.</p>

<p class="noin">She is there, solid, garrulous, herself. She does
not get husbands because she is a worshipped
goddess, but because she is a practical woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Bold indeed would be the lady who in imagination
played her part. The Wife is no empty
fancy dress in which we move and live; she is
well filled out with her own flesh, and we watch
her from outside as we would watch a neighbour.
Hers is no veil of dreams, but a good and costly
one, bought at Bristol Fair by one or other of
her five husbands whom she has badgered into
getting it.</p>

<p>Story-tellers before Chaucer seemed scarcely
to have realised that men were more than good or
bad, brave or coward. You hated a man, or you
loved him, laughed at, or admired him; it never
occurred to you to observe him. Every man was
man, every woman woman. It was not until the
Renaissance that modern story-telling found one
of its motives, which is, that there are as many
kinds of man and woman as there are men and
women in the world. Then, at last, character
and individuality became suddenly important.
Passion, reverence, charm had existed before in
story-telling. To these was now added another
possibility of the art in portrait painting. So
was the modern world differentiated from the dark
ages; blinking in the unaccustomed light, men
began to look at one another. In painting, almost
simultaneously with literature, the new power
found expression. The Van Eycks were alive
before Chaucer was dead, and in the careful, serene
painting of 'John Arnolfini and his Wife,' is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
observant spirit of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. That
woman standing there in her miraculously real
green robe, her linen neat upon her head, her hand
laid in her husband's, and her eyes regarding his
pious, solemn gesture as if she had consented in
her own mind to see him painted as he wished,
and not betray her sense of humour, the man, the
pattens on the floor, the little dog, and the detailed
chandelier, are all painted as if in Chaucer's
verse. The identity of them is the amazing thing;
their difference from all the other men and women
of the town, the difference of their room from all
other rooms, and their little dog from all other
little dogs. To compare that married couple
with any knight and lady carved in stone, hands
folded over breasts, on a tomb in an old church,
is to compare the modern with the medi&aelig;val, and
the Wife of Bath with Guenevere or the Wife of
Sir Segwarides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prose and
verse.</div>

<p>After Chaucer, narrative scarcely developed
except in prose. Scott, indeed, nearly five centuries
later, wrote his first tales in verse, but the rhyming
story-teller disappeared in the greater author
of the Waverley Novels.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Chaucer himself is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>interesting for marking the transition. He had
many attributes of later narrative, in his round
English humour, in his concern with actual life,
although in this essay I have only needed him to
illustrate the beginnings of the portrait-making
that has since become so important a byway of
the art. But while his verse in the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i> has the effect of good prose, his prose,
excellent elsewhere, is here unwieldy and beyond
his governance. He expressed the new attitude
in the old way; but when he was only nine years
old, there had been written in Italy prose tales
that have hardly been excelled as examples of the
two forms of the short story. Chaucer was born in
1340. In 1349 Boccaccio finished the <i>Decameron</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boccaccio.</div>

<p>Boccaccio had a more intricate mind than
Chaucer's, and a more elaborate life. He is said
to have been an illegitimate son of a Florentine
merchant and a Frenchwoman, and the two nations
certainly seem to have contributed to his character.
He spent six years of his youth apprenticed to a
merchant in Paris, forsook business, and was sent
to learn law, and only in the end persuaded his
father to let him devote himself to books. He
had a knowledge of the world uncommon even in
his day, and a knowledge of letters that was rare.
He was something of a scholar, something of a
courtier, and, particularly, something of a poet.
Sentence after sentence in the <i>Decameron</i> glides
by like a splash of sunlight on a stream with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
floating blossoms. I must quote one of his poems
in Rossetti's most beautiful translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'By a clear well, within a little field</div>
<div class="i2">Full of green grass and flowers of every hue,</div>
<div class="i2">Sat three young girls, relating (as I knew)</div>
<div class="i0">Their loves. And each had twined a bough to shield</div>
<div class="i0">Her lovely face; and the green leaves did yield</div>
<div class="i2">The golden hair their shadow; while the two</div>
<div class="i2">Sweet colours mingled, both blown lightly through</div>
<div class="i0">With a soft wind for ever stirred and still'd.</div>
<div class="i0">After a little while one of them said</div>
<div class="i2">(I heard her), 'Think! If, ere the next hour struck,</div>
<div class="i2">Each of our lovers should come here to-day,</div>
<div class="i0">Think you that we should fly or feel afraid?'</div>
<div class="i2">To whom the others answered, 'From such luck</div>
<div class="i4">A girl would be a fool to run away.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He could write a poem like that; he could write
the <i>Decameron</i>; he could write books of greater
impropriety; and at the end of his life could
beg his friends to leave such books alone, devoting
himself to the compilation of ponderous works
of classical learning. There is a legend of a deathbed
vision of Judgment where Boccaccio figured,
which, being reported to him, nearly gave the
wit, the scholar, and the gallant the additional
mask of the Carthusian religious.</p>
<div class="illuspage"><a id="boccaccio"></a>boccaccio</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/bocaccio.jpg" width="400" height="629" alt="" />
<div class="caption">GIOVANNI BOCCACCIO</div>
</div>

<p>But the Boccaccio of the <i>Decameron</i> was
the mature young man, of personal beauty, and
nimble tongue, a Dioneo, who had his own way
with the company in which he found himself, and
was licensed, like a professional jester, to say the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>most scandalous things. He knew the rich colour,
classical learning, and jollity of morals of the Court
of Naples. Here he heard the travelling story-tellers,
and perhaps learnt from them a little
of the art of narrative. He knew the <i>Gesta
Romanorum</i>, and began to collect tales himself with
the idea of making some similar collection. Noting
story after story that he heard told (for it would
be ridiculous to reason from the widespread origin
of his tales that he had a stupendous knowledge
of the world's books), he wrote them with a perfect
feeling for value and proportion. In him the
story-teller ceased to be an improviser. In his
tales the longwindedness of the <i>trouveurs</i> was
gone, gone also the nakedness of the anecdote.
He refused to excuse them with the moral tags
of the Gesta. These new forms were not things
of utility that needed justification; they were
things of independent beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
story-telling.</div>

<p>Boccaccio was intent simply on the art of telling
tales. He knew enough of classical literature
to feel the possible dignity and permanence of
prose, and he told his stories as they were told to
him in a supple, pleasant vernacular that obeyed
him absolutely and never led him off by its own
strangeness into byways foreign to the tales and
to himself. He found his material in anecdotes
of current gossip, like Cecco Angiolieri's misadventure
with his money, his palfrey, and his
clothes, and in popular tales like that of the overpatient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Griselda. He took it in the rough and
shaped it marvellously, creating two forms, the
short story proper, the skilful development of a
single episode, and the little novel, the French
<i>nouvelle</i>, a tale whose incidents are many and
whose plot may be elaborate. From his day to
our own these two forms have scarcely altered,
and in the use of both of them he showed that
invaluable art, so strenuously attained by later
story-tellers, of compelling us to read with him to
the end, even if we know it, for the mere joy of
narrative, the delight of his narrating presence.
We are so well content with Chaucer's gorgeous
improvisations that we never ask whether this piece
or that is relevant to the general theme. But in
Boccaccio there are no irrelevancies, praise that can
be given to few story-tellers before the time of the
self-conscious construction of men like Poe, and
the austere selection of men like M&eacute;rim&eacute;e and
Flaubert.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of framework
in
books of
short tales.</div>

<p>Even without their setting his tales would have
been something memorable, something that lifted
the art to a new level and made less loving workmanship
an obvious backsliding. But stories put
together do not make good books. The <i>Cent
Nouvelles Nouvelles</i> are very short and make a
collection of anecdotes. The <i>Exemplary Novels</i>
of Cervantes are very long and stand and fall each
one alone. But the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> are the
better for that merry company on pilgrimage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
And when Queen Joan of Naples, profligate,
murderess, and bluestocking, asked Boccaccio to
put his stories in a book, it was well that he
should have the plague of 1348 to set as purple
velvet underneath his gems&mdash;the morality inseparable
from the tales was so simple and so
careless. Boccaccio's attitude was that of his age.
Man has wants: if he can satisfy them, good: if
not, why then it may ease his sorrow to hear it
professionally expressed:&mdash;'Help me,' as Chaucer
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h3>THE ROGUE NOVEL</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Democracy
in literature.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Few</span> characters in literature have had so large or
so honourable a progeny as the gutter-snipe. If
the Kings' daughters of High Romance, charming,
delicate creatures, had only wedded with Kings'
sons, as delicately fashioned as themselves, we
should never have known the sterling dynasty of
the Tom Joneses and the Humphry Clinkers,
with their honest hearts and coarse hides warranted
to wear. All those Kings of men, whose thrones
were beer-barrels, whose sceptres, oaken cudgels,
whose perennial counsellor was Jollity, whose
enemy, Introspection, would never have come to
their own, and indeed would never have been born,
if it had not been for the sixteenth century entry
of the rascal into the Palace gardens, for the
escapades of such shaggy-headed, smutfaced, barefooted
urchins as Lazarillo de Tormes.</p>

<p>To such rogues as he must be attributed much
of our present humanity; for until we could laugh
at those of low estate, we held them of little
account. There is small mention made of serving-men
in the <i>Morte Darthur</i> or the <i>Mabinogion</i>,
and when, in the <i>Heptameron</i> of Margaret of
Navarre, we hear of the drowning of a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
them in trying to render easy the passage of their
masters through the floods, the comment is
extremely short: 'One must not despair for the
loss of servants, for they are easy to replace.' On
a similar occasion 'all the company were filled
with a joy inestimable, praising the Creator, who,
contenting himself with serving-men, had saved
the masters and mistresses,' an index alike to the
ferocity they still attributed to God and the
rather exclusive humanity of themselves. Do
you not think with sudden awe of the revolution
to come? Do you not hear a long way off the
trampling of a million serving-men, prepared to
satisfy God with other lives? It is a fine contrast
to turn from these queenly sentences to this little
book, the autobiography of a beggar, who thinks
himself sufficiently important to set down the
whole truth about his birth, lest people should
make any mistake. 'My father, God be kind to
him, had for fifteen years a mill on the river of
Tormes.... I was scarcely eight when he was
accused of having, with evil intent, made leakage
in his check sacks.... Letting himself be surprised,
he confessed all, and suffered patiently the
chastisement of justice, which makes me hope
that he is, according to the Gospel, of the number
of those happy in the Glory of God.' No very
reputable parentage this, in a day when it was
the fashion to derive heroes from Charlemagne
or Amadis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Lazarillo
de Tormes.</i></div>

<p>It is a short step from the ironic to the sincere.
The author of the book is laughing at his hero,
and makes a huge joke of his pretensions. But to
recognise, even in jest, that a vagabond rogue
could have pretensions, or indeed any personal
character at all beyond that of a tool in the hand
of whoever was kind enough to use him, was to
look upon him with a humaner eye and, presently,
to recognise him in earnest as a fellow creature.
It seems to me significant that the first rogues in
our literature should come from Spain, a country
that has never quite forgotten its Moorish occupation.
In the Spanish student, who, so tradition
says, wrote <i>Lazarillo</i> while in the University of
Salamanca, there must have been something of
the spirit of the race that lets the hunchback tell
his story to the Caliph, and is glad when the son
of the barber marries the daughter of the Grand
Vizier. For, joke as it is, the book is the story of
a beggar, told as a peculiarly fearless and brazen
beggar would tell it, without suggesting or demanding
either condescension or pity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The morality
of the
underworld.</div>

<p>There is genius in the little book. Its author
perhaps did better than he meant, for he brings
on every page the moral atmosphere of the underworld,
the old folk-morality, the same in sixteenth-century
Spain as in the oldest tales of sagacity
and cunning. Lazarillo's shameless mother apprentices
him to a blind beggar who promises to
treat him like a son and begins his education at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
once. He takes the boy to a big stone on the
outskirts of the town, and bids him listen to the
noise within it. The boy puts his head close
to the stone to hear the better, and the old rascal
gives him a thundering blow, which, the stone
being an admirable anvil, nearly cracks his skull.
That is his first lesson ... never to be unsuspicious
... and it is as characteristic of the
others as of <i>Reynard the Fox</i>.</p>

<p>There never was so excellent a beggar as
Lazarillo's master; no trick of the trade was
unknown to him. As a fortune-teller, he could
prophesy what his victims wished to hear. As
a doctor he had his remedies for toothache, and
for fainting-fits; not an illness could be mentioned
but he had a physic ready to his hands. Then
too, 'he knew by heart more prayers than all the
blind men of Spain. He recited them very distinctly,
in a low tone, grave and clear, calling the
attention of the whole church; he accompanied
them with a posture humble and devout, without
gesticulations or grimaces of mouth, after the
manner of those blind men who have not been
properly brought up.' Indeed his only fault was
avarice. 'He was not content with making me
die of hunger,' says his pupil; 'he was doing the
same himself.'</p>

<p>Under such a master Lazarillo's wits sharpen
quickly. 'A fool would have been dead a
hundred times; but by my subtlety and my good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
tricks, I always, or mostly (in spite of all his care),
succeeded in getting hold of the biggest and best
portion.' Lazarillo becomes as astute a rascal as
his teacher, and, living fairly and squarely in the
conditions of the underworld, his villainy does not
damp his spirits, or disturb his peace of nights.
I was reminded of him by a young tramp with
whom I walked in the north country, a rogue with
as merry a heart as he, and a similar well-fitting
morality. With me, from whom he knew there
was nothing to gain but good fellowship, he was
a good fellow, walked with a merry stride,
whistled as he went, sang me songs in the Gaelic
of his childhood, and told me of the jolly tricks he
had played with a monkey he had brought from
over sea. We walked like men in the sunshine.
But when, beyond a turn in the road, he saw some
person coming a little better dressed, why then
his face flashed into a winking melancholy, his
stride degenerated as if by magic into a slouch,
and it was odd if his mean figure and despairing
hand did not attract a copper, for which he would
call down a blessing. Then, as soon as we were
out of sight of his benefactor, he would resume
his natural walk and burst again into whistling
and merriment. Lazarillo is as frank as he. He
recognises his needs (Hunger is not an easy fellow
to ignore), and would be much surprised if you
denied his right to satisfy them. Nor is he disappointed
in you. Every honest man must love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
a rogue, and you are as consciencelessly glad as
himself when Lazarillo, by kneeling before him
and sucking the liquor through a straw, diddles
the blind man who greedily guards the wine bowl
between his ragged knees. You feel that he has
but his due when he happens upon a wife and
a living and (if you read the continuation of his
history<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>) find nothing blameworthy in the fact
that he spends his last years in the clothes and
reputation of a dead hermit, subsisting on the
charity of the religious.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The form
of the
rogue novel.</div>

<p>I have talked at some length about the contents
of this little book in order to illustrate the new
material then brought into story-telling. Let me
now consider the new form that came with it.
<i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i> was a very simple development
from the plain anecdote or merry quip of
folklore or gossip, which was, as we have seen in
the last chapter, one of the popular early forms of
narrative. Boccaccio raised the anecdote to a
higher level of art by giving it a fuller technique
and expanding it into the short story. The
inventors of the rogue novels achieved a similar
result by stringing a number of anecdotes together
about a particular hero, making as it were cycles
of anecdotes comparable in their humbler way
with the grand cycles of romance. Lazarillo himself
is not an elaborate conception, but simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>a fit rogue to play the main part in a score or so
of roguish exploits, idly following one another as
they occurred to the mind of the narrator. His
life is a jest-book turned into a biography, a
collection of anecdotes metamorphosed into a
novel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its satirical
material.</div>

<p>The new form gave story-telling a wider scope.
In writing a collection of anecdotes it was difficult
to realise the hero who was no more than a name
that happened to be common to them all. It was
impossible to make much of the minor characters
who walk on or off the tiny stage of each adventure.
But in stringing them along a biography,
in producing instead of a number of embroidered
exploits a single embroidered life, there need be
no limit to the choice and elaboration of the embroidery.
Though the hero was no more than a
quality, a puppet guaranteed to jump on the pull
of a string, the setting of his life turned easily
into a satirical picture of contemporary existence,
and satire became eventually one of the principal
aims with which such novels were written.</p>

<p>The low estate of the rogue novel's hero made
satire from his lips not only easy but palatable.
In writing the opinions of a rogue you can politely
assume that his standpoint is not that of his
readers. For that reason they can applaud the
rascal's wit playing over other people, or, if it
touches them too closely, regard it with compassion
as lions might listen to the criticism of jackals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
<i>Lazarillo</i> contains plenty of good-humoured,
bantering portraits: the seller of forged indulgences,
the miserly priest, and particularly the
out-at-elbows gentleman who walks abroad each
day to lunch with a rich friend, and is unable on
his return from his hungry promenade to keep
from eyeing, and at last from sharing, the rough
bread that his servant has begged or stolen for
himself. Lazarillo's merit is that he writes of
himself <i>&agrave; propos</i> of other people, and never barrenly
of himself for his own sake. Smollett in writing
<i>Roderick Random</i> is true to his traditions in getting
his own back from schoolmasters and the
Navy Office. And the arms of Dickens, who
reformed the workhouses in telling the story of
Oliver Twist, must have had quartered upon them
the rampant begging bowl of the little Spanish
rogue.</p>

<p>Now the characteristic language of satire is as
pointed as the blade of a rapier, and for this we
owe some gratitude to these rascally autobiographies
whose plainness of style was nearer talk
than that of any earlier form of narrative. The
prose of the picaresque novel has been in every
age remarkably free from the literary tricks most
fashionable at the time. When your hero dresses
in rags you cannot do better than clothe his
opinions in simplicity. The writing of <i>Lazarillo</i>,
of <i>Tom Jones</i>, of <i>Captain Singleton</i>, of <i>Lavengro</i>,
is clear, virile, not at all ornate, the exact opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to that of the Pastorals. Such heroes deliver their
sentences, like Long Melford, straight from the
shoulder, and would consider fine writing as so
much aimless trifling in the air.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Picaresque
autobiographies.</div>

<p>Mention of <i>Lavengro</i> suggests a paragraph on
one of the most curious developments to be
noticed in the history of the art. All that we
have examined so far have been from truth to
fiction; this is a movement from fiction to truth.
Stories of the deeds of a man have become
romances of the deeds of a hero. A biography
has changed as we watched it into a tale of
miracle. Here is a quite different phenomenon.
An imaginary autobiography that pretends to be
real, of a rascally hero, makes it possible for
rogues to write real autobiographies that pretend
to be imaginary. <i>Lavengro</i> and the <i>Romany
Rye</i> are two parts of a rogue novel constructed
like the oldest of the kind. They contain a hero
somehow put on a different plane from that of
respectable society, and the books are made up of
the people he meets and the things they say and
do to him, or make him do and say. 'Why,'
says Borrow, whose attitude towards life is as
confident as Lazarillo's, 'there is not a chapter
in the present book which is not full of adventures,
with the exception of the present one, and this
is not yet terminated.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
development
of the
rogue novel.</div>

<p>But Borrow and other makers of confessions
are not of the direct line, in spite of the roguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and adventurous air that clings about them as
they rest upon our shelves. <i>Lazarillo</i> had many
sincerer and more immediate flatterers&mdash;Thomas
Nash, for example, whose <i>Jacke Wilton, or the
Unfortunate Traveller</i>, holds in itself, as one of
the earliest pieces of realism in English literature,
more than enough of interest for an essay. He
had also many younger brothers at home, and an
enormous progeny, and it has so happened that
the influence of the rogue novel on our own
fiction was exerted through them, and not
through his early imitations in France and
England. Cervantes used its form for the adventures
of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and,
combining the picaresque spirit with that of the
tales of chivalry, produced the first realistic
romance. Many lesser writers were content to
follow Lazarillo's lead without such independent
ingenuity. They brought up their literary
children to be heroes after Lazarillo's fashion and
were proud to have him as a godfather. In their
hands the rogue novel retained its form and gained
only a multiplicity of incident, a hundred writers
earnestly devising new swindles and more exciting
adventures for the hero, whose personality under
all their buffetings remained constant to its
original characteristics. No nation has shown
more fertility in fancy than the Spanish. We
owe to Spain half the trap-door excitements, half
the eavesdropping discoveries, half the ingenious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>plots and counter-plots of the theatre. And
when we remember that for a hundred and fifty
years the rogue novel had been one of the most
popular forms of Spanish literature, we need not
wonder that Le Sage, in turning over volume after
volume of the lives of Spanish rascals, should find
that the Spanish language was an Open Sesame to
an Ali Baba's cave of opulent invention. Just as
a hundred forgotten trouveurs chanted the tales of
the <i>Morte Darthur</i>, before Malory made from their
songs the epic that we know, so the rogue novel
had seeded and repeated itself again and again,
before it met its great man who seized the vitality
of a hundred bantlings to make a breeched book.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its

<p>Just as Malory was not a Frenchman but an

Frenchman, and a Frenchman in a very different
age from that which produced his models. The</p>

<p class="noin">no longer brought the wealth of the Incas to Cadiz
and Barcelona, but had been burnt as firewood in
the cabins on the Irish coast. The Elizabethan
age had come and gone. Cervantes had been
dead a hundred years. Moli&egrave;re had brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>comedy to the French stage. Watteau was
painting, and Boileau was formulating the eighteenth-century
code of letters, when in a little
garden summer-house behind a Paris street, Le
Sage sat at his desk, dipped through Spanish
books, and wrote with a light heart of the
people that he knew, disguised in foreign clothes,
and moving in places he had never seen. He
made his travels by his own fireside, and the contrast
between Cervantes' active life and his peaceable
<i>Galatea</i> is no greater than that between the
adventurous Gil Blas and Le Sage's sedentary
industry. His lack of personal experience left
him very free in the handling of his material, and
made him just the man to recast the old adventures
of a century before, to translate them, spilling
none of their vitality, to a later time, to fill
them out with a more delicate fancy, to finish
them with a more fastidious pen, and to build
from them a new and delicious French book,
Spanish in colouring, but wholly Parisian in
appeal.</p>

<p>Gil Blas is a Frenchman in a Spanish cloak, Le
Sage, as he imagined himself under the tattered
mantle of Lazarillo. His disguise left him doubly
licensed for the criticism of contemporary France.
He was of low estate, so that he could see things
from below, upside down, and comment upon
them. His circumstances were Spanish, so that
he could observe French things, call them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Spanish names, and laugh at them without being
inexcusably impertinent. He had also a very excellent
technique. Le Sage had read La Bruy&egrave;re
and La Bruy&egrave;re's translation of Theophrastus, and
was the better able to allow his hero to take
the hint from Lazarillo, and use his autobiography
as an outlet for his social satire. Everything that
Lazarillo had done, Gil Blas did in a larger and
more skilful fashion. The book summed up the
rogue novels in itself, and in its own right brought
their influence to bear on English narrative.
Smollett translated it, and it shares with <i>Don
Quixote</i> the parentage of the masculine novel.</p>

<h2>THE ELIZABETHANS</h2>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE ELIZABETHANS</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The new
conditions of
professional
story-telling.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Professional</span> story-tellers before the sixteenth
century seem very far removed from the novelists
of our circulating libraries. Theirs was a simpler
patronage; they had but to please one rich man,
and they could live. The invention of printing
made them leap suddenly into the conditions of
modernity. It changed the audience of the
castle hall into the audience of the world, and
patrons into the public. A man told his stories
in his own room. He was not sure of a single
listener; he might have ten thousand without
raising his voice or pressing harder with his pen.
Poets might write for their friends or the Court;
but Elizabethan story-tellers were already able
to exist by writing for the booksellers. Middlemen
were between their audience and themselves.
They had no chance of excusing the defects of
their wares by charm of voice or charm of personality,
unless they could get that charm on paper.
The characteristics of modern story-telling were
rapidly appearing; already, as in the case of
<i>Euphues</i>, a single book might set the fashion for
a thousand; already the novelist felt his audience
through his sales. Men like Greene, swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
'yarkers up' of pamphlets, had to write what the
Elizabethan public wanted&mdash;with the result that
there is very little purely English story-telling of
the period. The Elizabethans wanted silks and
gold from overseas. They fell in love with what
was new and strange. They were hungry for all
countries but their own, and for all times but
those in which they lived. There never were such
thieves. They stole from Spain, from France,
from Italy, from Portugal, and, curiously mixing
impudence and awe, copied crudely and continually
from a newly discovered antiquity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elizabethan
borrowings.</div>

<p>There was <i>Paynter's Pallace</i>, peopled with
characters from the love-tales of France and Italy,
in whose adventures Elizabethan playwrights
found a score of plots. And then there was
<i>Pettie's Pallace</i>, with its delightful title, <i>A petite
Pallace of Pettie his pleasure</i>, that shows how
late our language lost its French. Pettie steals
his tales from the classics, with a most engaging
air of right of way. Wherever the Elizabethans
went they carried their heads high and were not
abashed. They were ready to nod to C&aelig;sar, call
Endymion a Johnny-head-in-air, and clink a glass
in honour of Ulysses. All the world was so new
that Antiquity seemed only yesterday. Classical
allusion was used with the most lavish hand.
Progne, inveighing against her husband, explains
his iniquity as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>

'He sheweth his cursed cruel kind, he plainly proves
himself to proceed of the progeny of that traitor Aeneas,
who wrought the confusion of Queen Dido, who succoured
him in his distress. It is evident he is engendered of
Jason's race, who disloyally forsook Medea that made him
win the golden fleece! He is descended of the stock of
Demophoon, who through his faithless dealing forced
Phyllis to hang herself! He seems of the seed of Theseus,
who left Ariadne in the deserts to be devoured, through
whose help he subdued the monster Minotaur, and escaped
out of the intricate labyrinth! He cometh of Nero his
cruel kind, who carnally abused his own mother Agrippina,
and then caused her to be slain and ripped open, that he
might see the place wherein he lay being an infant in her
belly! So that what but filthiness is to be gathered of
such grafts? What boughs but beastliness grow out of
such stems?'</p></blockquote>

<p>And yet, quite undismayed by such family
connections, so intimate was he with antiquity,
the story-teller sums up the deeds of his characters
as though he were a prosecuting counsel,
and they even now cowering in the dock before
him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'It were hard here, Gentlewoman, for you to give
sentence, who more offended of the husband or the wife,
seeing the doings of both the one and the other near in
the highest degree of devilishness&mdash;such unbridled lust and
beastly cruelty in him, such monstrous mischief and murder
in her; in him such treason, in her such treachery; in him
such falseness, in her such furiousness; in him such devilish
desire, in her such revengeful ire; in him such devilish heat,
in her such haggish hate, that I think them both worthy
to be condemned to the most bottomless pit in hell.'</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Lyly writes
for women.</div>

<p>There is something in the style of this, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
as in the address to a female reader, that suggests
the <i>Euphues</i> of John Lyly, published two years
later. Lyly, alchemist of Spanish magniloquence
into English euphuism, who settled the style of
the Elizabethan romance, and brought into it
many elements still characteristic of English story-telling,
wrote as well as his letter to 'Gentlemen
Readers,' and to his 'verrie good friends, the
Gentlemen Schollers of Oxford,' Epistles dedicatory
to women&mdash;'To the Ladies and Gentlewoemen
of England, John Lyly wisheth what they
would.' They were grateful to him, and since he
said that he would rather 'lye shut in a Ladye's
Casket, then open in a Scholler's studie,' there was
scarce a gentlewoman in London but knew much
of him by heart, addressed her husband or lover in
terms his Lucia might have used, and woke nearly
as eager to read in him as in her looking-glass. His
was a very modern success. Then, too, the end
of all his tales was high morality. He winds up
each with a reflection, and like most English story-telling,
they contain more of the Warning
Example than of the Embroidered Exploit. He
reminds the 'Gentlewoemen of England' that he
has 'diligently observed that there shall be nothing
found that may offend the chaste mind with
unseemly tearmes or uncleanly talke.' And yet
he wrote of love a hundred years before the
eighteenth century, and throughout those hundred
years, and for some fifty afterwards, the chaste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
mind was to be almost disregarded. Mrs. Aphra
Behn was to pour forth what Swinburne called her
'weltering sewerage,' and Fielding and Smollett
were to write, before the chaste mind was to exert
any very lasting influence on literature. Fielding
and Smollett wrote for men, while, like an earlier
Richardson, 'could Euphues take the measure of
a woman's minde, as the Tailour doth of hir bodie,
he would go as neere to fit them for a fancie as
the other doth for a fashion.' Elizabethan women
must have been less squeamish than their descendants
on the subject of themselves. For in this
book planned to fit them, Lyly writes like an
Elizabethan Schopenhauer:&mdash;'Take from them
their periwigges, their paintings, their Jewells,
their rowles, their boulstrings, and thou shalt
soone perceive that a woman is the least part of
hir selfe.' That is the gentle art of being rude, in
which so much of early wit consisted. But, as it
was designed as a 'Cooling Carde for Philautus
and all fond lovers,' whose affections were misplaced
or unrequited, the women, accepting not
without pride responsibility for the disease, must
have found it easy to forgive him and to smile at
so impotent a cure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Euphuism.</div>

<p>The style of Euphues had a much wider influence
than his matter. Like Pettie's, it is
precious, but with a preciousness at the same
time so elaborate and infectious that I am finding
it difficult even now, in thinking about it, to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
from imitating it. Its principle is a battledore-and-shuttlecock
motion, in which the sense, sometimes
a little bruised, is kept up between similar
sounds or words that are not quite puns but
nearly so. An idea that could be expressed in a
single very short sentence is expanded as long as
the breath lasts, or longer, by the insertion of
separate contrasts, like those used in the intermediate
lines of one of the forms of Japanese
poetry. There was something of this in Pettie's
peroration that was quoted three paragraphs ago;
and here is an example from Lyly:&mdash;'Alas,
Euphues, by how much the more I love the high
clymbing of thy capacitie, by so much the more
I feare thy fall.' (There is the idea; all that
follows is its embroidery.) 'The fine Christall is
sooner erased then the hard Marble; the greenest
Beech burneth faster then the dryest Oke; the
fairest silke is soonest soyled; and the sweetest
wine tourneth to the sharpest Vinegar. The
Pestilence doth most infect the clearest complection,
and the Caterpiller cleaveth into the
ripest fruite: the most delycate witte is allured
with small enticement unto vice, and most subject
to yeelde unto vanitie.'</p>

<p>Such a style could not but attract a newly
educated people, still able to marvel at knowledge.
Its lavishness of information is comparable
to that generosity of gold and precious
gems that has been noticed as characteristic of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
writers of the <i>Mabinogion</i>. The Briton wondered
at wealth, the Elizabethan at learning. It is not
surprising that in this state of civilisation a fact-laden
style should be brought to perfection.
'It is a sign of cruditie and indigestion,' says
Montaigne, 'for a man to yeelde up his meat even
as he swallowed the same: the stomach hath not
wrought his full operation unlesse it have changed
forme and altered fashion of that which was given
him to boyle and concoct.' In Elizabethan
England, when knowledge was so new and so
delightful that men did not scruple to invent it, it
is easy to imagine John Lyly writing with a huge
Bestiary open to the left of him, and a classical
dictionary open to the right, from which he might
dig out metaphors learned and ingenious, and
present them immediately to his readers without
putting any undue strain on his own intellectual
digestion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lyly's
followers.</div>

<p>His imitators were no less numerous than his
readers. If they could not write they talked his
peculiar language. If they were novelists they
wrote in something like his manner, and with
cheerful consciences used his name as a trade-mark
to attract his popularity to themselves. Lodge's
<i>Rosalynde</i> is introduced as <i>Euphues' Golden
Legacie</i>, and many other stories were connected
by some ingenious silken thread to Lyly's
garlanded triumphal car. It is too easy to laugh
at euphuism. It was the first prophecy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
ordered poetic prose in which such delicate work
has been done in our own time. In the hands
of Lodge and Greene, who tempered it with homelier
periods, it showed at once its possibilities
of beauty. Nor with Lyly was it continued
pedantry. A golden smile appears sometimes
beneath the mask. Euphues, crossing to England,
tells the story of Callimachus to Philautus and the
sailors, and when he says, 'You must imagine
(because it were too long to tell all his journey)
that he was Sea-sick (as thou beginnest to be,
Philautus),' we perceive that Lyly is not always
to be hidden behind his sentences. The stories
he introduces, the tale of Callimachus and
Cassander, or the pretty history of old Fidus and
his Issida, are as pleasant as the tales of Lodge
and Greene.</p>

<p>How near he was to being a story-teller may be
seen from the work of these two men. They
tried to imitate him in everything; but Greene
wrote in a hurry for the press, and you could not
expect Lodge, writing on the high seas, to be as
consistently euphuistical as an Oxford gentleman,
holding an appointment from Lord Burleigh, and
having nothing else to do. Euphuism fell away
from both journalist and sailor, leaving a pleasant
glow over their style. They were more intent
than Lyly on the plain forwarding of the narrative.
For the long rhetorical harangues they substituted
shorter, simpler speeches to express the feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
their characters. The harangue was a step from the
bald statement that so-and-so 'made great dole,'
and these shorter speeches were a further step from
the by no means bald declamations on the subject
of the dole, towards the working up of emotion
by a closer copy of the action and dialogue in
which emotion expresses itself. Dialogue was
yet to be introduced from the theatre. In Lyly it
meant argument, but in the best of his imitators
it had become already a tool imperfectly understood
but sometimes used for the actual progress
of the tale.</p>

<p>Greene and Lodge illustrate very well the
characteristics of Elizabethan story-telling.
<i>Pandosto</i>, <i>Rosalynde</i>, and some of Greene's
confessions let us know pretty clearly what it
was that the public of the day found interesting.
Greene was a Bohemian, 'with a jolley red peaked
beard' who could 'yark up a pamphlet in a single
night,' and do it so well that the booksellers were
glad to pay 'for the very dregs of his wit.' Lodge
was an undergraduate at Oxford, a pirate, and later
a very successful physician. Both were, like their
audiences, exceedingly alive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Romance
and
confession.</div>

<p>In Greene's <i>Pandosto</i> we find reminiscences
of old romance, classical nomenclature, the influence
of the Italian <i>novelle</i>, and plenty of the
wild improbability that still had power over his
audience. <i>Pandosto</i> is a love pamphlet, and
after a euphuistic dedication and a little preface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
on jealousy, 'from which oft ensueth bloody
revenge as this ensuing history manifestly proveth,'
Greene leads off with, 'In the country of
Bohemia there reigned a king called Pandosto.'
Bohemia is an island&mdash;no matter. Pandosto, in
a most obliging manner, 'to close up the comedy
with a tragical stratagem,' slays himself at the
finish&mdash;no matter again. We must remember
that for the Elizabethans, fortunate people who
believed in the Lamia and the Boas, probability
and improbability had no existence as relative
terms. Everything was credible, and one of the
joys of romance reading was the exercise of an
athletic faith. Another was the gathering of
knowledge, and Greene met this demand with
books whose breathings of realism illustrate, like
Nash's <i>Jacke Wilton</i>, the rogue novel in England,
and give his name a double importance. These
other books were more personal to their writer,
and depend more closely on his own life and
character. Greene was a wild liver with a
conscience. He enjoyed debauch and the company
of rogues better than virtue and the society
of sober citizens. But his conscience oscillated
between hibernation and wakefulness with a
periodicity that corresponded to the fulness and
emptiness of his purse, and in times of poverty
and righteousness he wrote confessions of his
own misdoing, and books on the methods of
rapscallions with whom he consorted, that brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
him the money to continue on his riotous career,
and satisfied the curiosity of his public as well as
his romances had delighted their imaginations.</p>

<p>Lodge, although his work was also various,
appealed mainly to the latter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Roome for a souldier and a sailer that gives you the
fruits of his labors that he wrote, in the ocean, when everie
line was wet with a surge, and every humorous passion
countercheckt with a storme. If you like it, so; and yet
I will be yours in duetie, if you be mine in favour. But if
Momus, or any squinteied asse, that hath mighty eares to
conceive with Midas, and yet little reason to judge, if he
come abord our barke to find fault with the tackling, when
hee knowes not the shrowds, Ile down into the hold, and
fetch out a rustie pollax, that sawe no sunne this seaven
yeare, and either well bebast him, or heave the cockescombe
over boord to feed cods. But curteous gentlemen, that
favour most, backbite none, and pardon what is overslipt,
let such come and welcome; Ile into the stewards roome,
and fetch them a kanne of our best bevradge.'</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i>As You Like
It.</i></div>

<p>That is the way in which Thomas Lodge,
newly returned to England from piracies on the
western seas, introduces his <i>Rosalynde</i>. With
such a preface, you would expect a ruffianly
tale, full of hard knocks and coarse words, certainly
not the dainty little pastoral, romantic
fairy story, found in Euphues' cell, and holding
lessons of much profit for the guidance of his
friend's children. The very contrast between its
buccaneering author and its own fragility is the
same as that between the pastoral writers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
their books, between, for example, Cervantes
of Lepanto and the author of the <i>Galatea</i>,
between the Sidney who died at Zutphen and
the author of <i>Arcadia</i>. It is the tale of <i>As You
Like It</i>, and Shakespeare, in turning it into a
play, chose the right title for it, since it contains
every one of the surest baits with which to hook
an Elizabethan audience. It was brought from
overseas, and in that time when ships were sailing
up to London Bridge with all the new-found
riches of the world, the hint of travel was a sufficient
promise of delight. It begins with a dying
knight who leaves a legacy between his sons, and
its audience had not yet tired of Sir Bevis and Sir
Isumbras. It has the fairy-tale notion of the
youngest born, and was not England youngest
son of all the world? There are beautiful women
in it, and one of them dresses like a man&mdash;a
delicious, romantic thing to dream upon. And
finally, is it not left by Euphues himself, and therefore
full of profit as of pleasure, of wit as of
wisdom, and written in something not too far from
that embroidered manner, as dear to the Elizabethans
as their new won luxuries, their newly
imported frivolities.</p>

<h3>THE PASTORAL</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The
discovery
and
exploitation
of Arcadia.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> Pastoral, whose influence touches even the
Elizabethan novels not professedly Arcadian, had
been fished up from sunken antiquity by the early
scholars of the Renaissance. They were fascinated
by the serene country pieces of Virgil, and the
leafy embroideries of Theocritus, and were, of
course, too newly learned, too eager for the name
of learning, to be able to apply the old form to
their own material. Instead, they did their best
to write not only in a classical manner, but also of
a classical country. They used Greek names,
Latin names, any but homespun names of their
own times. It was not on purpose that Arcadia
was set by them in the Golden Age; they had
aimed at a century more prosaic. The best time
of all the world had a date for them, and
they did their best to live up to its particular
antiquity. But in using conventions so different
from real life, in a time of hurry and stress,
it was natural that they should be led into daydreams
of a greater simplicity than their own
elaborate existence. It was natural, too, that by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>refining character, tempering the wind, and keeping
the year at its sweetest season, they should
end in the making of books that were beyond all
measure artificial. From the time of Boccaccio to
the time of Cervantes these books had multiplied,
and become more and more like arrangements of
marionettes in landscapes dotted with Noah's
Ark trees, until, when the curate in Don Quixote's
library defends them to the niece and calls them
'ingenious books that can do nobody any prejudice,'
the niece hurriedly replies, 'Oh! good sir,
burn them with the rest I beseech you; for
should my uncle get cured of his knight-errant
frenzy, and betake himself to the reading of these
books, we should have him turn shepherd, and so
wander through the woods and fields; nay, and
what would be worse yet, turn poet, which they
say is a catching and incurable disease.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shepherds'
plaints.</div>

<p>The niece was right, for when shepherds love
sweet shepherdesses, it seems that for the benefit
of a Renaissance public they must pour their
sorrows out in verse, as elegant and classical as
may be. No sooner does one shepherd begin his
song than another joins him and another, until
there is a chorus of complaining lovers; the infection
is so virulent that it leaps from man to
man, and if a shepherd-boy breathe a poem to his
lass, it is great odds that she will cap it with
another, and then they will keep it up between
them like a shuttlecock. The disease is so strong
indeed that if poor Corydon has no one to cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>

<div class="caption">SIR PHILIP SIDNEY</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">An apology
to Sidney.</div>

<p>This is no insult to Sir Philip Sidney, but only
to the rather exorbitant demands of the form he
had chosen. His own sonnets vindicate him as
a poet, and some of them, even Hazlitt owned,
who did not like him, 'are sweet even to a sense
of faintness, luscious as the woodbine, and graceful
and luxurious like it.' Sidney lets us see his own
attitude in that splendid sentence which begins,
'Certainly I must confesse my own barbarousnes,
I neuer heard the olde song of <i>Percy</i> and <i>Duglas</i>
that I found not my heart mooued more then
with a Trumpet; and yet is it sung but by some
blinde Crouder, with no rougher voyce then rude
stile'; I should be almost sorry that he finished it
by saying 'which, being so euill apparrelled in the
dust and cobwebbes of that vnciuill age, what
would it worke trymmed in the gorgeous eloquence
of <i>Pindar</i>?' but that it rings with the sincerity
of his classicism. Taste has changed, and now
we find his 'barbarousnes' in the question rather
than in the confession. But the sentence illustrating
at once his sensitiveness to simplicity and
his predilection for the classics, shows how genuine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>was the expression that the busy, chivalric diplomatist
found for himself in the confines of Arcadia.
The classic metres brought as near as might be
our Tudor English to 'the language of the Gods.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">The slow
progress of
Arcadian
narrative.</div>

<p>The continual downpour of poetry, the Arcadian
substitute for rain, was not the only drag on the
narrative of the pastoral story-tellers. Serenity
was considered essential, and so, while the story
was being everlastingly shunted, so that the lovesick
shepherds might plain, it had also for every
step it took forward to take another back in order
to catch again the chosen atmosphere of lovesick
repose. The result was 'a note of linked sweetness
long drawn out,' a series of agitated standstills,
and a narrative impossible to end. Cervantes'
<i>Galatea</i> was never finished; the last books of
<i>Arcadia</i> were written by another hand; d'Urf&eacute;
died before putting an end to <i>l'Astr&eacute;e</i>; and
Montemor abandoned his <i>Diana</i>.</p>

<p>In the history of story-telling it is not the form
of the pastoral that is important, but the motive
that gave it its popularity. We begin to understand
the motive when we notice that it became
the fashion to hide real people under the names
of Corydon and Phyllis, and to put ribboned crooks
and silver horns into the hands of enemies and
friends. At first it was the genuine feeling that
made Boccaccio enshrine his Fiammetta; at the
end it degenerated into mere privy gossip and
books uninteresting without their keys; but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
general it was simply a desire of flattering elaborate
people into thinking themselves of simple heart. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The motive
of the
Pastoral.<span class="hidev">|</span></span>The pastorals were like the paintings of Watteau
and Lancret, where we find the ladies of a lively
court playing innocent games under the trees, while,
if we searched in the brushwood, we should find
in the soft earth under the brambles the hoofmarks
of the sporting satyrs. The feelings of author and
subjects were those of the Vicar of Wakefield's
family when they sat before the portrait painter:&mdash;'Olivia
would be drawn as an Amazon, sitting
upon a bank of flowers, dressed in a green Joseph
richly laced with gold, and a whip in her hand.
Sophia was to be a shepherdess, with as many
sheep as the painter could put in for nothing.'
Elizabethan ladies liked to think of themselves
sitting on banks garlanding flowers, troubled
only by the sweet difficulties of love, and with
innumerable sheep, since the writer was able to
put them in so very inexpensively.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poussin's
<i>Les Bergers
d'Arcadie</i>.</div>

<p>There is another artist who, living before
Cervantes and Sidney were dead, gives in his
pictures, cleaner and sweeter than Watteau, an
idea of the pastoral spirit. You can imagine one
of Watteau's shepherdesses using paint. It would
be impossible to suspect the same of one of Sidney's,
or of one of Nicolas Poussin's, that solemn, sweet-minded
man who was shocked as if by sacrilege
at Scarron's irreverent treatment of Virgil. There
is in the Louvre (how many times have I been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
see it) a picture called 'Les Bergers d'Arcadie.'
Hazlitt mentions it, most inaccurately as to facts,
but most precisely as to feeling, in his essay on
the painter:<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;'But above all, who shall celebrate
in terms of fit praise, his picture of the shepherds
in the Vale of Tempe going out on a fine morning
in the spring, and coming to a tomb with this
inscription: <i>Et Ego in Arcadia vixi!</i> The eager
curiosity of some, the expression of others who
start back with fear and surprise, the clear breeze
playing with the branches of the shadowing trees,
"the valleys low where the mild zephyrs use," the
distant, uninterrupted, sunny prospects speak (and
for ever will speak on) of ages past to ages yet to
come!'</p>

<p>In those sentences Hazlitt, who found the
written pastoral dull, shows us the very secret of its
life. In trying to copy the classic country writing,
it came to be an attempt to reconstruct the time
that has always been past since the beginning of
the world. Real shepherds never do and never
did show fear and surprise and eager curiosity on
their weather-beaten faces; but then in Arcadia
is no rain. Sweet, sunny days, soft, peaceful
nights, green grass, white sheep, and smooth-cheeked
shepherds Grecian limbed; the whole is
the convention of a dream. It was the dream of
busy men in close touch with a life whose end was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>apt to come short and sharp between the lifting
of a flagon and putting the lips to it. And in
Sidney's dream especially, there is something of
the true Renaissance worship of the ancient gods.
Sidney's dream was of a pastoral life; yes, but to
him other things in it were more important than
its rusticity. For him, at least, it must be a life
where the goatfoot god still moved in the green
undergrowth, where Diana hunted the white
fawns, while Silenus tippled in the valley, and
Apollo looked serenely from the wooded hill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conventional
and
realistic art.</div>

<p>This was the same art as that of Malory,
though not that of the chansons or the sagas.
It is the art in which life is simplified into a
convention, and human figures worked into a
tapestry. The pastoral romances are duller than
those of chivalry, partly, no doubt, because their
conventions are not home-made but taken as
strictly as possible from another civilisation, and
partly because they are too long for their motives&mdash;the
pattern is repeated too often. But they do
not represent a dead or a dying art, but rather a
stage in the infancy of an art that has blossomed
in our own day, in some of the work of Th&eacute;ophile
Gautier, for example; in Mr. Nevinson's <i>Plea
of Pan</i>, in some of the drawings of Aubrey
Beardsley. Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i> is terribly unwieldy,
but passage after passage in it breathes a fragrance
different from anything in the literature of
realism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>

Indeed it is well to mark thus early the
distinction between these two arts, the one
that seeks to show us our own souls, the other
that shows us life, that one that, using symbols
disentangled from ordinary existence, can legitimately
fill books with things beautiful in themselves,
and the other that reconciles us to ugliness
by showing us some vital interest, some hidden
loveliness, some makeshift beauty in things as
they generally are. The spirit of the one set
statues of lovely forms in the bedchambers of the
Grecian women, the spirit of the other praises
ugly babies to their mothers. Both spirits have
shown their right to be by the works of art whose
inspiration they have been. We must only be
careful not to criticise the art of the one by the
canons that rule the art of the other. There are
two worlds, the actual and the ideal. If Tom
Jones were to open a door by saying 'Open
Sesame' to it, we should have a right to laugh,
just as we should be legitimately disappointed if
Ali Baba were to turn a key and enter the
robber's treasury in the ordinary way. We cannot
blame the Arcadian shepherds because they
are not like the shepherds we meet about the hills,
any more than we can blame that little kitchen
slut called Cinderella for riding to a king's ball in
a gold chariot made of a pumpkin. Truth to an
ideal is all we may ask of dreams. And the
pastorals, in spite of their borrowed conventions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
do hold an ideal, suffocated though it sometimes
is under an impossible technique, and the weight
of ornament which is so tempting to those who
have but newly learned the secrets of its manufacture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poetic prose.</div>

<p>Our later Arcadians have not so hampered
themselves. They have made short stories instead
of labyrinthine narratives, and they have been
able, as Sidney tried to do, to disclaim any competition
with utilitarian homespun literature by
the use of a poetic prose. In the prose of
Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>, imitated from that of Lyly, but
a little less noisily eccentric, falling perhaps too
often between poetry and prose, we can see the
promise of that new prose of ornament perfected
by the artists of the nineteenth century, a prose
firm, unshaken by the recurrent rhythms of verse,
but richer in colour and melody than the prose of
use.</p>

<h3>CERVANTES</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Prologue.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">It</span> is curious how many odds and ends may
be heaped together and woven into a patchwork
of thought, by a mind concentrating itself
upon one idea, and, as if in spite of itself,
making excursions after each chance butterfly
and puff of wind, each half promise of real or
phantom value it perceives. The mind returns
continually to where it stood, bringing with it
always something new, like a starling adding to
its nest, until at last the original idea is so covered
over with half visualised images, half clarified
obscurities, dimly comprehended notions, that it is
itself no longer to be seen but by a reverse process
of picking away and throwing aside, one by one,
the accretions that have been brought to it by the
adventuring mind. For the last hour I have been
sitting in my easy-chair, a cup of tea at my elbow,
a pipe in my mouth, a good fire at my feet, trying
not to let myself stray too far from the consideration
of Cervantes and his place in the history of
story-telling. All that hour, without effort,
almost against my will, my mind has been playing
about the subject, and bringing straw and scraps
of coloured cloth, until now the plain notion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Cervantes is dotted over and burdened with a
dozen other things&mdash;a comparison between an
active life and a bookish one, the relation between
parody and progress, the mingling of rogue novel
and romance, Sir Walter Scott, and the remembrance
of a band of Spanish village musicians.
Perhaps if I disentangle this superstructure piece
by piece Cervantes himself will become as visible
as he intends to allow me to present him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">An active
life and a
bookish one.</div>

<p>Cervantes was one of the men who write books
in two languages; in literature and in life.
Indeed, his contribution to his country's history is
scarcely less vivid than his share in the history of
story-telling. Cervantes the soldier, losing the
use of his hand in the naval battle of Lepanto, in
which he took so glorious a part that the grandiloquent
Spanish tradition attributed to him, a mere
private soldier, more than half the merit of the
victory, is quite as attractive as Cervantes the
impecunious author, writing plays for the theatre
and poems for the nobility, collecting taxes for the
king, pleasing himself with his <i>Galatea</i>, and laying
literature under an international debt to him for
his <i>Exemplary Novels</i> and his <i>Don Quixote</i>. Like
Sir Philip Sidney, he won admiration from his
contemporaries as much for his personal worth as
for his intellect. The maimed hand meant to
them and him as much as any printed books.
His own life was as romantic as his romance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Wherever he had found himself, boarding a
Turkish galley, plotting for freedom in the
prisons of Algiers, he had played the game as
stirringly as d'Artagnan. Don Quixote's patriotism
was no more obstinate and glamorous than
his, and Sancho Panza's wisdom was gained in no
school of harder knocks.</p>

<p>It is not without significance that his first book
should be a specimen of pastoral romance. The
<i>Galatea</i> bears no closer relation to workaday life
than Sir Philip Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>. This old
soldier began his career as a man of letters by
trying to settle upon an estate in Arcady, the
very country whose cardboard foliage he was
afterwards to ridicule, and the last book he wrote,
in spite of the humaner work that had preceded
it, was a romance not dissimilar from his first.
Partly this must have been due to the fashion
of the time; but it is not extravagant to find in
it an illustration of the wistful manner in which
men write about their opposites. Men like
Stevenson, caged in sick rooms, may love to be
buccaneers on paper. The real adventurers set
the balance even by imagining themselves tending
sheep on a smooth grassy slope.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Don Quixote</i>
no parody.</div>

<p>Cervantes' <i>Galatea</i> is not a great work. Its
shepherds weep more than Sir Philip Sidney's,
and sing considerably worse. But it had its
success, and Cervantes was never anything but
proud of it, a fact that should not be forgotten in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
remembering his <i>Don Quixote</i>. <i>Don Quixote</i> has
often been described as a parody of the heroic and
pastoral romances, which indeed had become a little
foolish. But Cervantes was not the man to jeer at
what he loved. Instead, he fills the old skins
that had held the wine of dreams with the new
wine of experience. He did not parody the old
romances, but re-wrote them in a different way.
Parody laughs and writes a full stop; the art of
Cervantes, Fielding, and Rabelais ends always in
a hyphen, a sign that allows all manner of
developments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
picaresque
form.</div>

<p>Cervantes, like Shakespeare, used all the
resources of his time, and did not disdain to
profit by other men's experiments. <i>Don Quixote</i>
owed a triple debt to the common-sensible
humorous rogue novel invented seventy years
before, as well as to the more serious tales of
knights and pastoral life that made his existence
possible. Thieves and shepherds and paragons
of chivalry assisted at his birth. The thieves in
particular were responsible for the design, or lack
of design, in the construction of the book. The
rogue novels were made by stringing a series of
disconnected 'merry quips' along the autobiography
or biography of a disreputable hero.
They were like Punch and Judy shows. The
character of Punch is as stable as his red nose or
his hump back. His deeds do not change him,
and, so long as he is always well in the front of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>his stage we ask for no other connecting thread
in the entertainment than his habit of punctuating
his conversation with a well-directed log of wood.
Let him continue his villainous career, let his
squeaking inhuman voice continue to exult, and
we are perfectly contented. It was so with the
rogues, and it is so with <i>Don Quixote</i>. As the
Bachelor says, 'many of those that love mirth
better than melancholy, cry out, give us more
Quixoteries: let but Don Quixote lay on, and
Sancho talk, be it what it will, we are satisfied.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rogue
novel and
romance.</div>

<p>Three hundred years after the Bachelor, we too
are satisfied with Sancho's chatter, and his
master's Quixoteries, because they are both pretty
closely connected with humanity. If Don Quixote
is among the clouds, Sancho Panza sits firm upon
his donkey, and between the two of them the
book itself moves spaciously upon a mellowed
earth. There is a perpetual interplay between
dignity and impudence, the ridiculous and the
sublime, and the partners, as if at tennis, lend
vigour and give opportunity to each other. Sancho
is not a mere village bellyful of common sense,
whose business is to make the Knight of the Doleful
Countenance appear ridiculous. He, too, has his
delusions; he, too, prefers sometimes those two
birds twittering distantly in the bush; Romance,
smilingly enough, has touched his puzzled forehead
also. And Don Quixote, with ideals no less
noble than those of Amadis of Gaul or Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Belianis of Greece, with notions of life no less
exaggerated than those in the interminable
pastorals, is yet a man of blood and bone. His
ideals and notions are properly fleshed, and are in
the book as a soul in a body. <i>Don Quixote</i> is
a book of dreams set upon earth, and earthly
shrewdness reaching vainly after dreams. The
rogue novels and the romances were, either of
them, the one without the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ideal
not spoilt
by the
reality.</div>

<p>We see Don Quixote's adventures with the
realist's eye of disillusion, and find that external
perfection does not matter to our dreams. ''Tis not
the deed but the intent.' The gorgeous charger of
the knight of chivalry is become a poor old starveling
hack that should have been horsemeat these
dozen years. Mambrino's helmet is but a barber's
bason after all. Lancelot's Guinevere is Dulcinea
of the Mill. Her feet are large and her shoulders
one higher than the other. The castle is a wayside
inn, the routed army a flock of luckless sheep.
The goatherds do not talk after the fashion of the
Court, like those in <i>Galatea</i>; but, 'with some
coarse compliment, after the country way, they
desired Don Quixote to sit down upon a trough
with the bottom upwards.' Gone are the rose-flecked
cloudy pinnacles of dawn; we know them
now for drenching rain. And yet&mdash;the play's
the thing, and is not judged by its trappings,
but by its beating heart. Not one scene in the
Romances, not one glimpse of the Happy Valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
in the Pastorals, has ever moved us like this book,
which is so near life that when we close it we
seem not to have flown on an enchanted carpet
from a thousand leagues away, but to have
stepped merely from one room to another of our
own existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>Exemplary
Novels</i>.</div>

<p>The <i>Exemplary Novels</i> were begun before <i>Don
Quixote</i>, and published afterwards. They are examples
rather of a form in story-telling than of
any particular piety. Cervantes was, he tells us,
'the first to essay novels in the Castilian tongue,
for the many novels which go about in print in
Spanish are all translated from foreign languages,
while these are my own, neither imitated nor
stolen.' He took the form of the Italian short
story, not the episode but the <i>nouvelle</i>, the little
novel that had inspired the Elizabethans. He
took this form and filled it with his own material,
told in his own manner. In thinking of that
manner I am reminded of the band of Spanish
village musicians who seemed at first to have no
obvious connection with my subject. There were
perhaps a dozen of them grouped on the stage of
a London music hall, and they played small
windy tunes, occasionally blaring out with
trumpets, using a musical scale entirely different
from our own. I remembered a Japanese I had
heard playing on a bamboo flute, and then the
semitones of a little henna-stained flageolet from
Kairouan. For theirs was Eastern music, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
I wondered if these Spaniards still owed their
scale to the old rulers of Granada. They set me
thinking whether the peculiar movement of
Cervantes' narrative had not also an Eastern origin.
The facts favour the supposition. Up to the
battle of Lepanto the Turks were so far a ruling
nation as to be the supreme sea-power; until even
later the most likely of incidents for the use of
the story-teller was that which happened to
Cervantes himself&mdash;capture by a Moslem pirate and
imprisonment in Algiers. Only a hundred years
had passed since the Moors had been driven from
Granada. It would indeed be surprising if in
Cervantes' work we found no sign of Eastern
influence. 'I tell it you,' quoth Sancho of his tale,
'as all stories are told in my country, and I cannot
for the blood of me tell it in any other way,
nor is it fit I should alter the custom.' Many
characteristics of Cervantes' narrative remind us
that he was writing in a country only recently
freed from the Moors, and in a time when it took
the united forces of Venice, Spain, and the
Papacy to beat the Turks at sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oriental
story-telling.</div>

<p>Cervantes is not ignorant, for example, of the
literary trick of letting his heroes quote from
the poets, after the engaging, erudite manner
of the heroes of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. Sancho
Panza's conversation is an anthology of those
short wisdom-laden maxims that had been the
staple of Hebrew and Arabic literature. 'Set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a hen upon an egg'; 'While a man gets he
never can lose'; 'Where there is no hook, to
be sure there can hang no bacon'; shrewd Ali and
careful Hakim exchange such sentences to-day in
the market-places of the East. But these are
small things and beside the main point. I want
to suggest that Cervantes had caught, whether
in his Algerine prison, or in his Morocco-Spanish
Spain, the yarning, leisurely, humanity-laden,
unflinching atmosphere of Oriental story-telling.
The form of the <i>nouvelle</i>, Eastern in origin, had
been passed on from Naples to Paris and to
London, without noticeable improvement, but it
seems to me that now in Spain it met the East
again, and was accordingly recreated. It is just
the element of Eastern narrative, accidental in
the genius of Cervantes, that makes his examples
of that form so infinitely more important than
those of the English Elizabethans. Scott told
Lockhart that the reading of the <i>Exemplary
Novels</i> first turned his mind to the writing of
fiction, and in Scott there is precisely the mood
of uninterruptible story-telling that Cervantes
shares with the Princess Scherazada.</p>

<p>The novels are delightful specimens of ambling,
elaborate narrative, full of the easiest, most confident
knowledge of humanity, illustrating with
serene clarity a point of view that is to-day as
refreshing as it is surprising. The happy endings,
when the seducer falls in love at sight on meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the seduced of years before, and satisfies all her
scruples, and turns her sorrow to unblemished joy
by marrying her, show an ethic of respectability
no less assured than Richardson's. They are
enriched by passages whose observation is as
minute as Fielding's. They are never tales about
nothing. There is always meat on their bones.
They are among the few stories that can be read
on a summer afternoon under an apple-tree, for
they will bear contact with nature, and are never
in a hurry. Even if Cervantes had not written
<i>Don Quixote</i>, the <i>Exemplary Novels</i> would have
assured him a place in the history of his art.
There is no cleverness in them, any more than in
the greater book. The whole body of Cervantes'
work is an illustration of the impregnable advantage
that plain humanity possesses over intellect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The portrait
of Cervantes.</div>

<p>And now, after these various questions for the
schoolmen, questions to more than one of which
the cautious man must answer with Sir Roger, that
'much might be said on both sides,' let us return
to the old story-teller himself, who will survive
by innumerable generations our little praises and
discussions as he has lived benevolent and secure
through the centuries that have already passed
over his grave. The only authentic portrait of
Cervantes is in his own words. A hundred artists
have tried to supplement these words with paint, and
their pictures have at least a family likeness. The
portrait made by Miss Gavin after a careful comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
parison of many others represents very fairly the
traditional Cervantes type, and does not materially
belie the lineaments that he describes:&mdash;'He
whom you here behold, with aquiline visage, with
chestnut hair, smooth and unruffled brow, with
sparkling eyes, and a nose arched though well
proportioned, a silver beard, although not twenty
years ago it was golden, large moustache, small
mouth, teeth not important, for he has but six of
them, and those in ill condition and worse placed
because they do not correspond the one with the
other, the body between two extremes, neither large
nor small, the complexion bright, rather white than
brown, somewhat heavy-shouldered, and not very
nimble on his feet; this, I say, is the portrait of
the author of the <i>Galatea</i> and of <i>Don Quixote de
la Mancha</i>.' That is the sort of statement of
himself that an honest humorous man might
make to a friend. Part of the satisfaction given
by his books is due to the comfortable knowledge
that there is a man behind them, a man who knew
the world and had not frozen in it. Cervantes,
for all his intimacy with life, never became worldly
enough to believe in hatred. He assumed that all
his readers were his friends, and made them so by
the assumption.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Epilogue.</div>

<p>No: Cervantes is too simple a man to do anything
but suffer in discussion. There are men
whom you know well, who seem to elude you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
like the final mystery of metaphysics when you
try to talk about them. My history and not Cervantes
is the clearer for the rags and tatters of
observation I have picked off him one by one.
I had put them there myself. It was necessary,
for the purposes of my book, to notice the
Eastern character of his story-telling and his
position between rogue novel and romance, but,
now that it is done, I am glad to go back to
him without pre-occupations. There is yet hot
water in the kettle, and tea in the pot, and four
hours to spend with <i>Don Quixote</i> before I go to
bed. Cervantes, at least, will bear me no malice,
but tell me his story as simply as before I had
tried to bring it into argument.</p>

<h2>THE ESSAYISTS' CONTRIBUTION
TO STORY-TELLING</h2>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE ESSAYISTS' CONTRIBUTION
TO STORY-TELLING</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The
Character.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> detailed, silver-point portrait studies of Fanny
Burney, the miniatures of Jane Austen, and the
stronger etchings of Fielding and Smollett, owed
their existence to something outside the art of
story-telling, something other than the grave,
humorous pictures of Chaucer, or the hiding of
real people under the homespun of lovesick shepherds,
or the gay autobiographies of swindling
rogues. They owed it to an art which in its
beginnings seemed far enough away from any sort
of narrative. In those happy, thievish times when
plagiary was a virtue to be cried upon the housetops,
this art, or rather this artistic form, had been,
like much else, stolen from antiquity.</p>

<p>When literature was for the first time become
a fashionable toy, and when, even at Court, a
gallant or a soldier was far outmatched by a wit,
the little book of <i>Theophrastus his Characters</i>
suggested a pastime that offered no less opportunity
than poetry for the display of nimbleness and
sparkling fancy. Life had become very diverse
and elaborate, and how delightful to take one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
its flowerings, one man, one woman, of a particular
species, and exhibit it in a small space, in a
select number of points and quips, each one
barbed and sticking in the chosen target. Sir
Thomas Overbury, trying to define the art he
used so skilfully, said, in his clear way:&mdash;'To
square out a character by our English levell, it is
a picture (reall or personall) quaintly drawne, in
various colours, all of them heightned by one
shadowing. It is a quicke and soft touch of many
strings, all shutting up in one musicall close: it
is wit's descant on any plaine song.' The thing
had to be witty; it had to be short. A busy
courtier could compose one in a morning while his
barber was arranging his coiffure, and show it
round in the afternoon for the delectation of his
friends and the increase of his vanity. He could
take a subject like 'A Woman,' and with quick
sentences pin her to the paper like a butterfly on
cork. Then he could take another title, like 'A
Very Woman,' and repeat his triumph with
another variety of the species. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Sir Thomas
Overbury.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Sir Thomas
Overbury, that charming, insolent, honest man,
the friend of Somerset, venomously done to death
by his Countess for having given too good advice
to her husband, is perhaps the most notable of the
early practitioners. He is not to be despised for
his sage poem on the choice of a wife, but he is at
his best in the making of these little portraits, like
that of the 'Faire and happy Milk-mayd,' wherein,
in accordance with his definition, he could polish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
each detail without jarring his musical close, and
without nullifying the single shadowing designed
to heighten the whole. The form was fitted to
the times like their fashions in clothes. The
Character belonged to that age, like the novel
to the nineteenth century. Sir Thomas, as his
title-page tells us, was assisted by 'other much
learned gentlemen'; he was presently followed by
a man as different from himself as gentle John
Earle, Doctor of Divinity, and just such a student
as an Inns of Court man like Sir Thomas would
naturally despise. So general was the inclination
of the age to portraiture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Earle.</div>

<p>With Earle we are nearer the drawing of individuals,
and so to a tenderer touch on idiosyncrasies.
He relies less on quaint conceits (though
he has plenty of them and charming ones at
command; witness the child whose 'father hath
writ him as his owne little story, wherein hee
reads those dayes of his life that hee cannot remember')
and trusts more often to fragments of
real observation. His Characters are not so consistently
wit's descant on a plain song. He is
often content to give us a plain descant on a plain
song&mdash;less concerned with his cleverness than
with his subjects. With Earle we are already some
way from the age of Elizabeth, and indeed Overbury,
though he was able to quarrel with Ben
Jonson, and in spite of his Renaissance death,
seems to have a part in a less youthful century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
In his wisdom, in his wise advice unwisely given to
his friend, there is something already of the flavour
of Addison; an essence ever so slight of the sound
morality of the periodical essayists whose work
owed more than a little to his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">La Bruy&egrave;re.</div>

<p>The same impulse that suggested the pleasure
and profit of collecting Londoners as Theophrastus
had collected his Athenians, suggested also the
noting of contemporary manners. Manners and
Characters, especially since Characters meant
peculiarities, belonged to each other. Overbury's
'Pyrate' is a picture of the times quite as much
as of that sterling fellow they produced, to whom
if you gave 'sea roome in never so small a vessell,
like a witch in a sieve, you would think he were
going to make merry with the devill.' And the
portrait of 'The Faire and happy Milk-mayd'
betrays in its painting more than a little of the
artist and of the age in which she sat for him.
This is true of the plain Character, unexpanded
and unframed; it is still more true of the Character
in the form it very speedily took. The
Character became a paragraph in a discursive
essay, and La Bruy&egrave;re, who copied directly from
Theophrastus, does not make series of separate
portraits, but notices in his original less his
picturing of types than his suggestion of their
circumstances, dividing his own work into large
sections, 'de la ville,' 'de la Cour,' 'des Biens de
Fortune,' 'de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; et de la Conversation,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
where he seems to stroll slowly through a garden-walk
of philosophy, pointing his remarks with his
stick, and using such portraits as he cares to make
to illustrate his general observations. His Characters
are almost anecdotes. He is like the more
advanced naturalist who, no longer content with
his butterflies on cork and his stuffed birds stiff on
perches, attempts to place them in the setting of
their ordinary existence, where they may illustrate
at once that existence and their own natures by
some characteristic pose. How near is this to the
desire of seeing them alive and in continuous
action, which, if he had had it, would perhaps have
made him combine his notes and sketches in a
novel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
periodical
essayists.</div>

<p>The periodical essayists had La Bruy&egrave;re, and
Earle's <i>Microcosmography: A Piece of the World
discovered in Essays and Characters</i>, and Sir
Thomas Overbury with his much learned gentlemen,
and Theophrastus, the father of them all,
well in their memory. They too were collectors
of Characters and observers of public morals
and censurers of private follies. La Bruy&egrave;re's
aims with something more were theirs. Hazlitt's
is so excellent a description of their work
that I shall quote it instead of writing a stupid
one. '<i>Quicquid agunt homines nostri farrago
libelli</i>, is the general motto of this department of
literature.... It makes familiar with the world
of men and women, assigns their motives, exhibits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
their whims, characterises their pursuits in all
their singular and endless variety, ridicules their
absurdities, exposes their inconsistencies, "holds
the mirror up to nature, and shows the very age
and body of the time its form and pressure";
takes minutes of our dress, air, looks, words,
thoughts, and actions; shows us what we are, and
what we are not; plays the whole game of human
life over before us, and by making us enlightened
spectators of its many coloured scenes, enables us
(if possible) to become tolerably reasonable agents
in the one in which we have to perform a part.'
We might be listening to a description of the
eighteenth century novel of manners. Fanny
Burney would have recognised these pretensions
for her secret own, though she might have blushed
to see them so emblazoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minuteness
of
observation.</div>

<p><i>The Tatler</i>, <i>The Spectator</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>,
and the rest of them, are like a long series of
skirmishes in a determined campaign on the part
of the essayists to cross the borderland of narrative.
Their traditions, the Character, Montaigne, and
Bacon, were very different from those of the story-tellers.
The canvases prescribed for them were
not huge things almost shutting out the sky, but
a very small stock size, two or three pages only,
to lie two days on coffee-house tables, and be
used for wrapping butter on the third. The
essayists were like men compelled to examine an
elephant with a pocket microscope. Each subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
small as it was, hid all others for the moment, so
that their observation made mountain peaks and
ranges out of pimples and creases. These very
limitations sharpened the weapons of their
struggle, the weapons that were at last to be
taken over by the novelists. The small canvas
made carelessness impossible, and this compulsory
attention to detail gave a new dignity to the trivialities
that the novelists had so far overlooked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr.
Bickerstaff.</div>

<p>The very conception of these papers contained
an accidental discovery of a possibility in fiction.
<i>The Tatler</i> was not written by Steele, or Swift,
or Addison, or indeed by any one of its contributors,
but by a Mr. Isaac Bickerstaff, an oldish
gentleman, a bachelor, a lover of children and
discreet good fellowship, of an austere but kindly
life, possessed by a pleasant, old-gentlemanly
desire to better the manners of the town. This
is personal, yes, but ... and the <i>but</i> has the
dignity of the sentence ... the personality is
imaginary. It is a Character so far alive as to be
able to conduct a magazine. It was a utilitarian
conception. Steele was, or pretended to be,
vastly annoyed when the authorship was found
out and his own jolly person discovered under the
sober clothes of Mr. Bickerstaff. 'The work,' he
says, 'has indeed for some time been disagreeable
to me, and the purpose of it wholly lost by my
being so long understood as its author.... The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
general purpose of the whole has been to recommend
truth, innocence, honour, and virtue as the
chief ornaments of life; but I considered that
severity of manners was absolutely necessary to
him who would censure others, and for that reason,
and that only, chose to talk in a mask. I shall
not carry my humility so far as to call myself a
vicious man, but at the same time must confess,
my life is at best but pardonable. And, with no
greater character than this, a man would make but
an indifferent progress in attacking prevailing and
fashionable vices, which Mr. Bickerstaff has done
with a freedom of spirit, that would have lost both
its beauty and efficacy, had it been pretended to
by Mr. Steele.' It is as if we were to hear Defoe
apologising for dressing up as Robinson Crusoe,
assuring us that his book is but an allegory, and
telling us with due solemnity that he has lived
with his wife these many years, and hardly above
once set foot on shipboard, and then only between
London Bridge and Greenwich. Steele was quite
unaware that <i>The Tatler</i> was an embryo novel.
And yet, what is it, but an imaginary character,
sometimes meeting other imaginary characters,
and experiencing subjects instead of undergoing
adventures?</p>

<div class="caption">RICHARD STEELE AND JOSEPH ADDISON</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
Character
and the
short story.</div>

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff was in himself a contribution to
character-study in fiction; the daily talks that
were put into his mouth by Steele and his friends,
supplied others no less valuable. The Character,
the neat driven team of short sentences, became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>in his hands something like a story. It became an
anecdote with no other point than to bring alive
the person described. And the portraits became
less general. Types turned into individuals.
Ned Softly, for example, is not called 'a very
Poet,' and hit off with, 'He will ever into Company
with a Copy of Verses in his Pocket; and
these will be read to all that suffer him. Every
Opinion he taketh for Praise, and Ridicule in his
Ears soundeth like Flattery.' He is given the
name by which he is known in private life. We
see him walk into the room, hear his preliminaries,
watch his battery unmasked as he opens his
pocket, listen to his verses, hear them again, line
by ridiculous line, observe him batten on the
opinions he extracts, and see him hide his darlings
at the approach of sterner-featured critics.
The Character is become a little scene. The moth
has no pin through his middle, but flaps his way
where we may see him best. Here is the very
art that Fanny Burney, that charming show-woman,
was to use for the exhibition of Madame
Duval; here the alchemy that was to turn
puppets into people. It is the same that gave
Pygmalion his mistress. The essayists owed
much to their own hearts, or to the heart they set
in 'our' Mr. Bickerstaff, for if you love a man as
well as you laugh at him, it is great odds that he
will come alive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr.
Bickerstaff's
letter-box.</div>

<p>Steele probably got a few letters from unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
correspondents, dull and stupid as such things are.
Perhaps in laughingly parodying them at the
coffee-house tables he caught the idea of inventing
better ones for Mr. Bickerstaff's assistance.
Perhaps, when hard pressed for time, thrown to
the last minute for his work by some merry
expedition with the Kit Kats to talk and drink
wine under the mulberry-tree on Hampstead
Heath, he found he could get quicker into a
subject through the letter of a servant girl than
through Mr. Bickerstaff's first-personal lucubrations.
However that may be, much of the best
reading in both <i>Tatler</i> and <i>Spectator</i> is held in
the letters supposed to be written to the man who
was supposed to write the whole. These letters
are not mere statements of fact, to serve instead
of Latin quotations as texts for essays. They are
imitations, 'liker than life itself,' of the letters of
reality. Each one of them is written by some
individual person whose impress on its writing is
so clear that the letter makes a portrait of himself.
Even the cock in Clare Market has a personality
quite his own when he sends Mr. Bickerstaff a
petition. And as for the Quaker; remember how
he would have been described in the old manner,
and read this:&mdash;</p>

<p>Could anything of the kind be better? It
needed only a series of such letters, consistent to
a few characters, and dealing with a succession of
events, to produce a 'Humphry Clinker.' The

<div class="sidenote">Sir Roger
de Coverley&mdash;a
novel.</div>

<p>If I were asked which was the first English
novel of character-study, as I am asking myself
now, I should reply, as I reply now, those essays
in the <i>Spectator</i> that are concerned with Sir Roger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
de Coverley. Set that little series of pictures in a
book by themselves, as has been done with appropriate
and delightful illustrations by Mr. Hugh
Thomson, and in reading them you will find it
hard to remember that you are not enjoying a
more than usually leisurely kind of narrative.
The knight is shown to us in different scenes; we
watch him at the assizes, leaning over to the judge
to congratulate him on the good weather his lordship
enjoys; we see him smile in greeting of Will
Wimble; we watch him fidget in his seat with
impatience of the misdeeds of the villain in the
play; we hear of his death with a tear in our eye
that is a testimony to the completeness and
humanity of the portraiture. If only his love-story
were thinly spread throughout the book and
not begun and ended in a chapter, <i>Sir Roger de
Coverley</i> would be a novel indeed. As it is, in that
delicate picture of a country gentleman and
country life&mdash;for Sir Roger does not stand against
a black curtain for his portraiture, but before his
tenants and his friends&mdash;we have the promise of
<i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i> and of <i>Cranford</i>, and of
all that chaste and tender kind of story-telling
that is almost peculiar to our literature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Johnson and
Goldsmith.</div>

<p>Johnson and Goldsmith followed the tradition.
Even the ponderous Doctor could step lightly at
times, and never so lightly as when he obeyed the
instinct that turns discussion into fiction and essays
into sketches. He too can write his letters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that from Mrs. Deborah Ginger, the unfortunate
wife of a city wit, is a story in itself. And as for
Goldsmith, he can hardly hold his pen for half a
paragraph before it breaks away from the hard
road of ideas and goes merrily along the bridle-path
of mere humanity. His letters from Lien
Chi Altangi, that serious Chinese busied in exposing
the follies of the Occident, turn continually to
story-telling. A wise remark will usher in an
Eastern tale, and, not even in the papers of Steele
or Addison are the subjects of characters, like the
little beau, who would have been a 'mere indigent
gallant,' magicked so deliciously to life. Finally,
he did with 'The Man in Black' what Addison
and Steele could so well have done with Sir
Roger. Fielding and Smollett had written before
him, and he saw that he could follow their art
without resigning any of the graces of the
essayist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The later
essayists.</div>

<p>The eighteenth century saw the absorption of
the periodical essayists into avowed story-telling.
Miss Burney left them nothing to do but to write
sketches for chapters that might have appeared in
her books. The essayists who came later could
only make beautiful examples of a form that was
already a little old-fashioned, though, following
other suggestions, they experimented in a new
direction and found another art to teach to story-tellers.
Leigh Hunt's pair of early nineteenth-century
portraits, 'The Old Gentleman,' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
'The Old Lady,' betray the family likeness of the
character as it was known to Overbury. Lamb's
portrait of Mrs. Battle is nearer modern story-telling.
He does not let us into more than one
of Sarah Battle's secrets, but in telling us of her
attitude towards the game of whist he shows us
how she looked upon the game of life. We would
know her if we met her, even if she were not
seated at the card-table, the candles unsnuffed,
the fire merry on the hearth, and in the faces of
her and her partner and foes the frosty joy of 'the
rigour of the game.' Hazlitt, though he stuck
close to his Montaigne, and cared less to illustrate
himself by other people than by his own opinions,
gives us characters too&mdash;that noble one of his
father!&mdash;and his account of Jack Cavanagh the
fives player, and his description of his going down
to see the fight, are splendid passages of biography
and narrative. But the gift of the later essayists
to story-telling was the new art of reverie, and of
the description of an event so soaked in the
describer's personality as to be at once an essay
and a story. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The art of
reverie.<span class="hidev">|</span></span> Few forms are richer in opportunity
either for essayist or story-teller, than that
which made possible Lamb's 'Dream Children,'
and in which the child De Quincey, who had been
in Hell, could show us the calamity of three
generations of beautiful children, and ask at last
whether death or life were the more terrible, the
more to be feared. It is sufficient to mention the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
names of Walter Pater and Mr. Cunninghame
Graham to show that some of the finest work of
modern times has been done in this kind of story-telling,
and is being so done to-day. And this
art, this most delicate art of suggested narrative,
is it not also&mdash;to return, perhaps a little fancifully,
to the tragic old knight's definition&mdash;is it not also
'a picture in various colours, all of them heightned
by one shadowing'? Is it not also 'a quicke and
soft touch of many strings, all shutting up in one
musicall close'?</p>

<h3>TRANSITION: BUNYAN AND DEFOE</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The old
world of
fairy tale.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> hundred years between the Elizabethan
romancers and the English novelists was not a
period of great story-telling like the fifty that
were to follow it, or the first half of the nineteenth
century. It is of interest here mainly because
it witnessed a complete change of audience, the
gradual transition of all the arts from a light-hearted
and credulous old world to a careful and
common-sense new one. The change is made
very clear by a comparison of the stories popular
before and after.</p>

<p>Robert Burton gives us a fairly accurate notion
of the story-telling of the first quarter of the
century, in a paragraph of <i>The Anatomy of
Melancholy</i>. He is referring to spoken tales, but
his description applies quite as well to tales in
print. 'The ordinary recreations which we have
in winter, and in the most solitarie times busie
our minds with, are cards, tables and dice ...
merry tales of errant knights, queens, lovers,
lords, ladies, giants, dwarfs, theeves, cheaters,
witches, fayries, goblins, friers, etc., such as the
old woman told Psyche in Apuleius, Bocace
novels, and the rest, <i>quarum auditione pueri
delectantur, senes narratione</i>, which some delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to hear, some to tell, all are well pleased with.'
In short, the material of Shakespeare's plays, of
Spenser's <i>Fa&euml;rie Queene</i>, of the early rogue books,
and of the tales imitated from Italy and antiquity
by Greene and Lodge and Pettie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A more
sober spirit.</div>

<p>By 1640 things had already changed a little.
James Mabbe, the quaint flavour of whose Tudor
style, endearing as the moss on an old house,
reminds us that he published his translation of
six of the <i>Exemplary Novels</i> before Cervantes
had been dead for a quarter of a century, felt
that he had to apologise for them to the more
sober spirit of the time. 'Your wisest and
learnedst Men,' he writes, 'both in Church and
Common-weale, will sometimes leave off their
more serious discourses, and entertain themselves
with matters of harmelesse Merriment and Disports.
Such are these stories I present unto your
view. I will not promise any great profit you
shall reape by reading them, but I promise they
will be pleasing and delightful, the Sceane is so
often varied, the Passages are so pretty, the
Accidents so strange, and in the end wrought to
so happy a Conclusion.' That marks very neatly
the mid-seventeenth-century attitude towards
the art. It was not impossible that the simple
unascetic humanity of Cervantes would be taken
amiss by these people who were stirred by the
forces that were producing a Cromwell and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Bunyan, a Commonwealth and a <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>.
Only, in contradiction to this, the translator
could make a confident appeal to a Pepysian
delight in pretty passages, strange accidents, and
happy conclusions&mdash;a delight only different from
that of the Elizabethans in its anxiety to be able
to write 'harmelesse' when it had enjoyed them.</p>

<div class="illuspage"><a id="bunyan"></a>bunyan</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/bunyan.jpg" width="400" height="625" alt="" />
<div class="caption">JOHN BUNYAN</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Bunyan's
world.</div>

<p>Before the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> was written there
had come to be two parties in the audience: one
with an epicurean delight in loose living, and one
whose care was for a stern decency that postponed
all flamboyance to a future life. The men of the
first party flung their roses the more joyously for
their antagonism to the sober black of the others,
and were all the merrier for the thought that
most of the community held them damned,
although, when Bunyan wrote, theirs was the
outward victory. Consciences were violently
stirred, and so were either hardened absolutely,
or else unmistakably alive. If you were good
you were very very good, and if you were bad
you were horrid, like the little girl in the rhyme.
There had been revolutions and counter-revolutions;
and likes and dislikes were pretty strongly
marked, because men had had to fight for them.</p>

<p>Bunyan's business was the description of a
pilgrim's progress through a world thus vividly
good and bad. His choice of allegory as a
method allowed him to illustrate at the same
time the earnestness of his times and their extraordinary
clarity of sensation. It was a form ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to his hand. The authorised version of the Bible,
published in 1611, its English retaining the
savour of a style then out of date, formed at once
his writing and his method, as it constituted his
education. 'My Bible and Concordance are
my only library in my writings.' And, himself
a minor prophet, he could quote from Hosea:
'I have used similitudes.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
justification
of allegory.</div>

<p>Bunyan's use of them was very different from
Spenser's. Hazlitt said of <i>The Fa&euml;rie Queene</i>
that, if you left the allegory alone, it would leave
you; and his advice may be safely followed. It
is not so with Bunyan, and his allegory must be
defended in another manner. It needs defence,
for although it is one of the oldest and pleasantest
ways of producing wisdom-laden stories, it is so
easy to use badly that people have become a
little out of patience with it. We remember the
far-fetched explanations tagged on to the <i>Gesta
Romanorum</i>, and refuse any longer to be fobbed
off with puzzles that are easy to make and hard
to solve. We demand that a book shall have cost
its author at least as much as it costs us. Allegory
is like fantasy, either worthless, or not to be
bought with rubies and precious stones; with anything,
in fact, but blood. When Bunyan writes:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'It came from my own heart, so to my head,</div>
<div class="i0">And thence into my fingers trickled;</div>
<div class="i0">Then to my pen, from whence immediately</div>
<div class="i0">On paper I did dribble it daintily,'</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="noin"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
he sets up the one plea that is an absolute
justification of his method; that it is 'dribbled
daintily,' and came from the depths of him. The
old monks wrote their stories, and searched their
heads for a meaning. But Bunyan thought for
himself, and could not think without seeing.
His heart's talk was in passionate imagery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bunyan and
the early
painters.</div>

<p>He was the son of a tinker, and a tinker himself,
and saw his visions as clearly as he saw his tin
pans. His book is never opalescent with the shifting
colours of a vague mysticism. It is painted in
tints as sharp and bright and simple as Anglo-Saxon
words. Bunyan had to throw himself into no
trance in order to watch the pilgrim's arrival at the
New Jerusalem. The Celestial City was as real
to him as London, and there seemed to him no
need to describe it in a whisper. His eyes were
as childlike as those of the early painters, who
clothed the builders of the Tower of Babel in
fifteenth-century Italian costume, put a little
bonnet on the head and a flying cloak about the
shoulders of Tobias, and set soft leather boots on
the feet of the angel. The whole of the <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i> is contemporary with Mr. Pepys. 'Now
Christiana, if need was, could play upon the viol,
and her daughter Mercy upon the lute; so, since
they were so merry disposed, she played them a
lesson, and Ready-to-halt would dance. So he
took Despondency's daughter, named Much-afraid,
by the hand, and to dancing they went in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
road. True, he could not dance without one
crutch in his hand; but, I promise you, he footed
it well. Also the girl was to be commended, for
she answered the music handsomely.' It might
be Mr. Pepys himself describing the frolic of
some friends. And yet it was the most natural,
righteous thing in the world, since Great Heart
had killed Giant Despair, and Despondency and
Much-afraid had just been freed from the
dungeons of Doubting Castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fear of
Life.</div>

<p>It is characteristic of the English spirit that the
greatest national classic of piety should be written
by a man whose relish for life was in no way
blunted by his thoughts of immortality. Bunyan
had a fear of life no less real than his fear of God,
and loved both God and life the better for fearing
them. Men set capital letters to the Fear of God,
and there is a Fear of Life no less different from
cowardice. Bunyan, a brave man, imprisoned
again and again for his beliefs, and more than once
in imminent danger of hanging, shows in a
passage of his <i>Grace Abounding</i> this Fear of Life
in a very glare of light. Bunyan had loved bell-ringing,
and, after he had come to consider it not
the occupation of a man whose profession was
so perilous and serious as a Christian's, he could
not help going to the belfry to watch those
whose scruples still allowed them his favourite
pastime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>'But quickly after, I began to think, "How if one of the
bells should fall?" Then I chose to stand under a main
beam, that lay athwart the steeple from side to side, thinking
here I might stand sure; but then I thought again,
should the bell fall with a swing, it might first hit the wall,
and then rebounding upon me, might kill me for all this
beam. This made me stand in the steeple door; and now
thought I, I am safe enough, for if a bell should then fall,
I can slip out behind these thick walls, and so be preserved
notwithstanding. So after this I would yet go to see them
ring, but would not go any further than the steeple door; but
then it came into my head, 'How if the steeple itself should
fall?' And the thought (it may, for aught I know, when I
stood and looked on) did continually so shake my mind, that
I durst not stand at the steeple-door any longer, but was
forced to flee, for fear the steeple should fall upon my
head.'</p></blockquote>

<p>A man who felt as vividly as that, and was as
stout as Bunyan, taking existence as he would
take a nettle, took it with a grip as firm as that
of love, and loved and feared his life as he loved
and feared his God. He knew that brightness
and clarity of sensation desired by Stendhal when
he wrote, 'The perfection of civilisation would be
to combine all the delicate pleasures of the nineteenth
century with the more frequent presence
of danger.' Life was very actual to him, and so,
in this account of a pious dream, we find the
clearest prophecy of that sense for reality that
distinguishes the novels of the eighteenth century.
The <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> was the first great story of
that series of books that was to paint the English
character in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Facts.</div>

<p>A fact is something very like an Englishman.
It is a thing complete in itself, and satisfactory on
that account. There is no vanity about a fact,
and, as a people, we hate showing off. I can
think of no other nation as hungry for fact as ours,
none with a book that corresponds to the <i>Newgate
Calendar</i> and has been so popular, none with a
book of spiritual adventure so actual as the
<i>Pilgrims Progress</i>, none with a book of bodily
adventure comparable with <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.
Defoe and Bunyan stand for the plain facts of
religion and existence, in both of which they
found so English a delight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The instinct
for verisimilitude.</div>

<p>Bunyan's book is an account of a dream. It is
not a frank fairy tale demanding a certain licence
of nature to make possible its supernatural events.
Like the <i>Romance of the Rose</i>, unlike the <i>Fa&euml;rie
Queene</i>, it takes its licence in its first sentence&mdash;'As
I slept, I dreamed'&mdash;and is able thenceforth
to be as miraculous as it pleases without much
loss of credibility, since miracle, if not consistency
and continuity, is of the very element of a dream.
It was an instinct for reality that made Bunyan
give his story such a setting. Giants and dwarfs
could no longer be jostled with thieves and cheaters
as when Burton wrote. And Defoe, writing
another forty years later, shows this same instinct
for reality very much more conscientiously developed.</p>

<div class="illuspage"><a id="defoe"></a>defoe</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/defoe.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">DANIEL DEFOE</div>
</div>

<p>With an imagination scarcely less opulent than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>Bunyan's, Defoe, if he had described a dream,
would have managed somehow to make it as
short-winded and inconsequent as a real one. He
was in love with verisimilitude, and delighted in
facts for their own sakes. 'To read Defoe,' wrote
Charles Lamb, 'is like hearing evidence in a
Court of Justice.' No compliment could have
pleased him better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamb and
Defoe.</div>

<p>The letter in which Lamb paid it him was
written at the East India House, immediately
after the labour of entering the accounts of a tea
sale. Careless as it is, it contains a criticism of
Defoe's books that goes to the root of his method.
Here is its kernel. 'The author,' writes Lamb,
'never appears in these self-narratives (for so they
ought to be called, or rather, autobiographies), but
the <i>narrator</i> chains us down to an implicit belief
in everything he says.' (It is interesting to notice
that Defoe, a very early realist, obeyed the spirit
of Flaubert's maxim, that a writer should be
everywhere invisible in his work, and that his
books should, so to speak, tell themselves.)
'There is all the minute detail of a log-book in it.
Dates are painfully impressed upon the memory.
Facts are repeated over and over in varying
phases, till you cannot choose but believe them.'
Then follows the sentence already quoted. Lamb
goes on: 'So anxious the story-teller seems that
the truth should be clearly comprehended, that
when he has told us a matter of fact or a motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in a line or two farther down he repeats it, with
his favourite figure of speech, 'I say,' so and so,
though he had made it abundantly plain before.
This is an imitation of the common people's way
of speaking, or rather of the way in which they
are addressed by a master or mistress, who wishes
to impress something on their memories, and has
a wonderful effect upon matter-of-fact readers.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">The new
world of
matter-of-fact.</div>

<p>There is little to add to that, though Lamb
'had not looked into them latterly,' or he would
have noticed in Defoe's books, with his quick eye
for such things, Defoe's wary way with anything
that seems to him at all incredible. In <i>The
Journal of the Plague Year</i>, for example, none of
the more dramatic anecdotes are vouched for by
the writer. He heard them from some one else,
did not see them with his own eyes, finds them
hard to believe, and so rivets the belief of his
readers. We shall observe in discussing
Hawthorne the more advanced possibilities of
this ingenious trick. The best books of Defoe's
are rogue novels, and in none of them was he
content with a merely literary reality. His heroes
are as solid as ordinary men, or more so.
The figure of Selkirk shrinks away like a faint
shadow behind that of Crusoe, whose imaginary
adventures his own had suggested, and there can
be no doubt in anybody's mind as to which of
the two is the more credible. And then there is
that style of his, homelier even than Bunyan's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
though less markedly so, since he is describing
homelier things. There is no Euphuism here;
Defoe was not the man to deal in gossamers.
The essayist's delicacy of line had not yet been
given to the story-tellers, and Defoe was not the
man to deal with silver point. His style is as
simple and effective as a bricklayer's hod. He
carries facts in it, and builds with them alone.
The resulting books are like solid Queen Anne
houses. There is no affectation about them; they
are not decorated with carving; but they are
very good for 'matter-of-fact readers' to live in.
Matter-of-fact readers made Defoe's audience, and
the hundred years since Burton wrote had made
a matter-of-fact English nation out of the credulous
Elizabethans. The eighteenth century opens
with this note. The tales the old woman told
Psyche have been blown away like dead leaves
into heaps for the children to play in, and grown-up
people, serious now, have done with fairy tale
and are ready for the English novel.</p>

<h3>RICHARDSON AND THE
FEMININE NOVEL</h3>

<div class="sidenote">For women
by women.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Euphues</span> had addressed a dedication to the 'Ladies
and Gentlewomen of England,' and had said
openly that he would rather lie shut in a tiring
closet than open in a study; but, writing for
women as he did, he never tried to write as if he
were himself a woman. On the contrary, Lyly's
attitude was that of the gallant. The Elizabethan
romancers who followed him were read by women
but content to be men. Mrs. Behn, whose 'weltering
sewerage' we have not had space to discuss,
wrote for women, but certainly not less coarsely
than if she had been writing for her own heroes.
It was not until the eighteenth century that there
was fairly launched a new story-telling, characteristically
English in origin, without the fine
careless heroism and improbability of romance,
that it held was 'calculated for amusement only,'
and different also from the mischievous realism
of the picaresque. These ships, with their gallant
scarlet and gold pennons, and their merry skull
and cross-bones, had been long afloat before there
came to join them a white barge with a lily at the
prow and on her decks girls in white dresses, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
their heads close together telling stories to each
other. The author of a tale had hitherto been
either a man, a god, or a rascal; he had never been
content to be a girl. And the first of the new
craftswomen was a fat and solid little printer and
alderman of the City of London, called Samuel
Richardson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Samuel
Richardson.</div>

<p>Richardson was an author of a kind quite new
to English letters&mdash;neither a great gentleman like
Sidney, nor a roisterer like Greene, nor a fanatic
preacher like Bunyan, nor a journalist like Defoe;
just a quiet, conscientious, little business man,
who, after a duteous apprenticeship, had married
his master's daughter like a proper Whittington,
and, when she died, had married again, with
admirable judgment in each case. It is not every
one who can marry two wives and be unhappy with
neither. As a boy, he had written love-letters
for young women who were shy of their abilities.
Girlish in his youth, he had preferred the tea-table
to the tavern. Surrounded by women in his manhood,
he was a grotesque little figure of a man, as inquisitive
as an old maid, as serious over detail as
a village gossip; walking in the Park, and looking
at the feet of the women he met, and, as they
passed him, quickly scanning their faces, and
saying to himself, 'that kind of person,' or 'this
kind of person,' and then going on to observe and
summarise the next. He was accustomed, like a
Japanese draughtsman, or a woman in a theatre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>to complete and instantaneous observation. His
was just the mind to show women what they could
do; and this, with their constant applause and help,
he did.</p>

<div class="caption">SAMUEL RICHARDSON</div>
</div>

<p>He had a lifetime of feminine society behind
him when he was asked to write a series of letters
on 'the useful concerns in common life' for the
guidance of servant-girls, and, setting himself to
the task, produced <i>Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded</i>,
and then, stepping on from his success, <i>Clarissa
Harlowe</i>, and finally the monstrous <i>Grandison</i>.
The books were written in a close atmosphere of
femininity. 'My worthy-hearted wife and the
young lady who is with us, when I had read them
some part of the story, which I had begun without
their knowing it, used to come into my little
closet every night, with&mdash;"Have you any more of
Pamela, Mr. R.? We are come to hear a little
more of Pamela."' Every letter of Clarissa's was
canvassed by the tea-parties that wept and trembled
for her fate, and worshipped her proud little
creator. And all his friends contributed their
ideas of the perfect man to the making of Sir
Charles Grandison. No author had ever written
so before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The novel
by post.</div>

<p>I believe that the femininity of the resulting
books was due to his choice of the epistolary
method as well as to his own temperament, and
his enviable opportunities of studying the character
of the audience at which he aimed. If he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
happened upon it, if he had tried to tell his stories
in the manner fashionable at the time, they would
but have been exaggerations and amplifications
of tales that Steele would have put most comfortably
into a single number of <i>The Tatler</i> or <i>Spectator</i>.
If he had used the autobiographical form
he would have been prohibited from much of his
detail, and all the effect of lighting his subject
from several points of view. But letters were so
new in story-telling that they helped him to be
new himself, just as a new and unusual fashion of
coat helps a man to be militantly original, within
as well as without. And then letters, always describing
events that have scarcely happened,
excuse the most unlimited detail, the most elaborately
particularised gossip or confession. Letters
were the perfect medium for the expression of the
feminine mind.</p>

<p>I do not deny that there are disadvantages in
the novel by post, that concerns many characters
in elaborate play. Richardson has, for example,
to keep his corresponding couples, naughty Lovelace
and uneasy Belford, Clarissa and the giddy
Miss Howe, dodging apart again and again for the
purpose of exchanging letters. We are tortured
by Pamela's efforts for the good of her story, her
letters sandwiched between tiles and buried in
earth, the incredible agility of her postman John,
and the forethought and luck that enables her to
provide herself with ink and paper in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
impossible circumstances. And when Mr. Belford
writes of Clarissa, 'there never was a woman so
young who wrote so much and with such celerity,'
we look at the huge volumes and find it easy to
believe him. When we hear that 'Her thoughts
keeping pace with her pen she hardly ever stopped
or hesitated, and very seldom blotted out or
altered,' we reflect that she certainly had not the
time. And when later we are told that 'Last
night, for the first time since Monday last, she got
to her pen and ink; but she pursues her writing
with such eagerness and hurry as show her discomposure,'
we cannot help smiling to think how
very advantageous such discomposure must be to
Mr. Richardson, who is to edit the correspondence.
There is this difficulty of credibility, and
also occasional even more obvious awkwardnesses,
as when the characters, always very obliging to
their creator, have to enclose copies of letters that
would not otherwise have got into print.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richardson
does not
attempt
illusion.</div>

<p>On the other hand, we cannot count these as
serious blemishes on a form of art so far removed
from any attempt at illusion. There is in
Richardson's novels no sort of visualised presentment
of life. We see his principal characters
through little panes of glass over their hearts, and
in no other way. I cannot for the life of me
imagine what Clarissa really looked like, but I
know well enough what she thought. Spasmodic
reminders of Pamela's abstract prettiness produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
little but an impatient desire to see a portrait.
I remember but one glimpse of her, and that is in
the first volume, when she has dressed herself up
in her new homespun clothes, dangles a straw hat
by its two blue strings, and looks at herself in the
looking-glass. There comes an expression a little
later, 'a pretty neat damsel,' and again, 'a tight
prim lass,' and I think that the ghost of a little
girl shows in the looking-glass, but only for a
moment, like the reflection of a bird flying over
a pool of water. Richardson's characters are
decreasingly real from their hearts outwards.
They have no feet. But their hearts are so
beautifully exhibited that we cannot ask for anything
else. To quarrel over them with Richardson
is like quarrelling with the delightful Euclid
because no one has ever been able to draw a
straight line that should really be length without
breadth. Such a line does not exist outside
his books, yet Euclid is all in the right when
he talks of geometry. Pamela and Clarissa do
not exist outside their propositions, yet Johnson,
talking fairly honestly, was able to say that there
was more knowledge of the human heart in a
letter of Richardson's than in all <i>Tom Jones</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The passion
for respectability.</div>

<p>It is knowledge of the human heart from the
girl's point of view&mdash;the unromantic girl, for
Richardson could never bring himself to believe
in great passions. He would never have used as
the text of a novel that sentence from the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Testament that has inspired so many later story-tellers:
'Her sins are forgiven her because she
loved much.' Richardson's only passion is one
not usually so called, and that is a passion for
respectability. The desire for respectability, for
her children's sake if not for her own, is part of
every woman's armour in the battle of this world.
In Richardson's two best novels it is something
far more than this, an obsession that love cannot
conquer nor goodness override. In Clarissa it is
so Quixotic, so forlorn a hope as to be noble;
but Pamela's respectability is a little disgusting.
What, after all, is Pamela's story but the tale of
a servant-girl who declaims continually about her
honesty, writes foolish verse about it, lets her head
fall on her master's shoulder, and refuses to be
his except as his wife? She is quite right, of
course, and most estimable. But her affronted
virtue does not seem much more than a practical
commercial asset, when she successfully marries
the man who by every means in his power has
sought to destroy it. Clarissa, on the other hand,
has nothing to gain, nothing even to retain, except
her self-respect. The respect of Howes, Belfords,
and Harlowes could weigh but little with a being
lifted from ordinary Philistine life into a conflict
as unworldly as hers. She has the ivory dignity
of some flowers, and the curious power of the
book that traces her misfortunes is due to the
spectacle of so flowerlike and fragile a being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
engaged in a struggle so terribly unequal. The
struggle itself could hardly have been imagined
by a wholly masculine writer. It is a kind of
elaborate proposition, not a picture of life. It is
like a chess problem in which we know that white
mates in two moves, and are interested only
in seeing how he does it. In Richardson, as in
Euclid, we know always what is coming. Our
artistic pleasure is in the logic and sequence of the
intervening steps. If you expect a theorem to
turn into a problem or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, the inevitability
of Richardson annoys you; but if you read him
in the right spirit that quality is your chief
delight.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice that Richardson, inventing
girls' theorems, is unable to draw a hero
in whom a man can believe. Lovelace, for
example, is touched in in a way that makes women
fall in love with him, but men feel for cobwebs
in the air. Pamela's master is frankly incredible.
And it is no bad illustration of Richardson's
femininity that Charles Grandison, planned as the
perfect man, has been found unbearable in the
smoking-room, insipid at the tea-table, and has
probably had no conquests but a few Georgian
ladies'-maids. But the women, abstractions,
algebraical formul&aelig;, as they are, let us into secrets
of the machinery of a woman's mind that no
earlier novelist had been able to examine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Richardson's
influence.</div>

<p>Richardson's precise, intimate, feminine knowledge
of women and feminine method of writing
had a wider influence than that we
are tracing in this chapter. He showed story-tellers
a new world to conquer and quite unexplored
possibilities in the telling of a tale. It
was for this that he was translated by the Abb&eacute;
Pr&eacute;vost, the Jesuit, soldier, priest and novelist,
who wrote in <i>Manon Lescaut</i> of a passion greater
and more self-sacrificing than any that had come
in the way of the little printer of Salisbury Court.
And when St. Preux and Julie exchange those
letters that brought a new freedom of sentiment
into literature, Rousseau, who taught them how
to write, had himself been taught by Richardson.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Fanny
Burney.</div>

<p>I do not intend any detailed portraiture of the
later writers of the feminine novel, but only in a
brief mention of two of them to suggest the course
they took in the development of their art, until in
the nineteenth century it combined with and became
indistinguishable from the masculine novel
that held it at first in a not lightly to be reconciled
hostility. Let us look along the bookshelf for a
volume called <i>Evelina, or the History of a Young
Lady's Entrance into the World</i>. Thirty years
had passed between the publication of <i>Clarissa</i>
and that of Fanny Burney's best book, and in
those years Fielding and Smollett had written,
and <i>Humphry Clinker</i> had shown that it was
possible to describe in letters other things than a
series of attacks on the armour of respectability.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Fanny Burney took more material with a lighter
hand, stealing away the business of <i>The Tatler</i>,
<i>The Spectator</i>, <i>The Citizen of the World</i>, and
trying not only to 'draw characters from nature'
but also to 'mark the manners of the time.' She
had learnt from a diligent perusal of Richardson,
avoided a too elaborate postal system, and made
her butterfly task the easier by writing of herself,
whereas he had to invent the Clarissas and Pamelas
of his more bee-like labours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Young lady's
'manners.'</div>

<p>Fanny Burney was the daughter of a popular
music-master, whose house was always full of
all sorts of people, so that she had the best of
opportunities for observing that surface of life
which she was able so incomparably to reproduce.
She was able to see manners in contrast. Now
'manners' described by a man in a coffee-house&mdash;by
Steele, for example, or Goldsmith, mean
the habits and foibles of contemporary society.
'Manners' 'marked' at a young lady's rosewood
desk mean vulgarity and its opposite, and the
various shades between the two. In the essayist's
eyes, manners were simply manners, to be described
each one for its own sake. The feminine novelist
found manners either good or bad, and was concerned
with the tracing of a gossamer thread of
distinction. The story of Evelina is not so much
that of her love-affair with Lord Orville, but of
the suffering or satisfaction of a sensitive person
exposed alternately to atmospheres of bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
manners or good. Evelina threads her way shyly
along the border-line, and illustrates both sides by
their effects upon her happiness. We are sorrier
for her when she hears Miss Branghton cry out
joyfully, 'Miss is going to marry a Lord,' than
when she is in more serious trouble over her
acknowledgment by her father. All the minor
characters for whom the story makes a frame
are set there as types less of character than of
behaviour. There is Mrs. Selwyn with her habit
of 'setting down' young men, and her characteristic
praise of Lord Orville, 'there must have been
some mistake about the birth of that young man;
he was, undoubtedly, designed for the last age;
for he is really polite.' There is Captain Mirvan,
representing good birth and brutality of manners;
Madame Duval, low birth seeking to veil itself
in lofty affectation; the Branghtons, frank vulgarity;
Mr. Smith, the tinsel gentility of the
Holborn beau. Each character is in the book
in order to inflict its peculiar type of manners
on the heroine, so that we may watch the
result. Evelina herself, delicious as she is, is
given to us as a touchstone between good breeding
and vulgarity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feminine
standards of
delicacy.</div>

<p>Miss Burney marks very clearly the introduction
of the feminine standards of delicacy that
were to rule the English novel of the nineteenth
century. Evelina's criticism of <i>Love for Love</i>,
written less than a hundred years before she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
it, distinguishes honestly between her own point
of view and that of the best of men. 'Though it
(the play) was fraught with wit and entertainment,
I hope I shall never see it represented again; for it
is so extremely indelicate&mdash;to use the softest word
I can&mdash;that Miss Mirvan and I were perpetually
out of countenance, and could neither make any
observations ourselves, nor venture to listen to
those of others. This was the more provoking, as
Lord Orville was in excellent spirits, and exceedingly
entertaining.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jane Austen.</div>

<p>Twenty years after <i>Evelina</i>, the novel of femininity
took a further step in technique and breadth
of design. Miss Austen, who in the last decade of
the eighteenth century was writing the novels
that were not to be published till after the first
decade of the nineteenth, learnt from both her
precursors. She was a proper follower of
Richardson, but dispensed altogether with the
artifice of letters, although the whole of her
work is so intimate and particular in expression
that it would almost seem to be written in a
letter to the reader.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Like Miss Burney she had
read the masculine novels of an ordinary life,
whose strings were not so finely stretched as
those of life in the books of the sentimental little
printer; she had read Fielding and Smollett and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>the Essayists, and Miss Burney herself, but she
carried the satire she had learnt from them deeper
than Miss Burney's criticism of well or ill-bred
manners. She deals more directly with existence.
Miss Burney with lovable skill made her puppets
play her game. Miss Austen's puppets played
a game of their own. She remarked before
writing <i>Emma</i>, 'I am going to take a heroine
whom no one but myself will much like,' exactly
as if she were a little girl rather capriciously
choosing a new plaything. But Emma, once
chosen, illustrates no special theorem, and is
compelled to tread no tight-rope over the abyss of
vulgarity. Miss Austen's world has the vitality
of independent life, and is yet close under observation,
like society in a doll's house. Her people
are alive and real, and yet so small that she found
it easy to see round them and be amused. Indeed,
she grew so accustomed to laughing at them
that she came to include the reader in her play.
I am not sure if it would not be wise for any
one who found a page of hers a little dull or incomprehensible,
to consider very carefully and
seriously if she is not being mischievous enough
and insolent enough to win her silvery laugh
from his own self. To read her is like being in
the room with an unscrupulously witty woman;
it is delightful, but more than a trifle dangerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The analysis
of the heart.</div>

<p>But Miss Austen's satire is not so important as
the clear, keen sight that made it possible. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
feminine novel finds its justification and characteristic
in the quick light gossiping knowledge of
Miss Burney, in Miss Austen's bric-&agrave;-brac of
observation, in Richardson's topographical accuracy
among the hidden alleys and byways of
the heart. Its tenderness of detail is its most
valuable contribution to story-telling, associated
though it is with feminine standards of decency,
and the sharp point of feminine raillery. The first
of these concomitants is a gift of doubtful, and
certainly not universal, virtue. The second is no
more than a variation, a different-tinted, other-textured
version of the satire of men. But the
gift to which they were attached has made possible
some of the finest work of later artists, in those
stories whose absorbing interest is the unravelling
of tangled skeins of intricate psychology. Theirs
is a minuteness in the dissection of the heart quite
different from, and indeed hostile to, the free-and-easy
way of men like Fielding and Smollett, and
wherever we meet with this fine and delicate
surgery practice we can trace its ancestry with
some assurance to the feminine novel of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<h2>FIELDING, SMOLLETT, AND
THE MASCULINE NOVEL</h2>

<h3>FIELDING, SMOLLETT, AND THE
MASCULINE NOVEL</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The English
Renaissance.</div>

<p class="noin">I <span class="smcap">have</span> always felt that the English Renaissance
was considerably later than that of France or
Italy, and happened in the eighteenth century.
When we speak of the Italian or the French
Renaissance we mean the times in the histories of
Italy or France when the peculiar genius of each
of these countries showed the most energetic and
satisfying efflorescence. In Italy and in France
this time was that of the revival of classical learning,
when Boccaccio lectured on Dante at Florence
and Ronsard gardened and rhymed. In England,
although from the time of Chaucer to the time
of Shakespeare we were picking continental
flowers, and flowering ourselves individually and
gorgeously, yet we had no general efflorescence in
our national right, no sudden and complete self-portraiture
in several arts at once. And this in
the eighteenth century was what we had. All
our national characteristics were unashamedly on
view. Our solidity, our care for matter of fact,
our love of oversea adventure, were exhibited in
Defoe. Our sturdy spirituality had only recently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
found expression in Bunyan. Richardson discovered
the young person who, rustling her petticoats,
sits with so demure an air of permanence on
Victorian literature, and represents indeed so real
a part of our national character that we shall never
be able to forget her blushes altogether. Our
serious turn for morality showed itself at once in
the aims all our authors professed, and in the
pictures of Hogarth who, with courage unknown
elsewhere, dared to paint ugliness as ugly. This
is the century that represents us in the eyes of
the world. If we would think of the Italian
spirit we remember the <i>Decameron</i>; if of the
French, we remember Ronsard's 'Mignonne,
allons voir si la rose,' or Marot's 'Mignonne, je
vous donne le bon jour.' But if a Frenchman
tries to describe an Englishman his model is not
a Chaucer but a Jean Bull, and the only adequate
portraits of Jean Bull are to be found in the novels
of Fielding and Smollett.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">HENRY FIELDING</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Two points
of view.</div>

<p>Out of this general efflorescence were to spring
two branches of story-telling different and hostile
from the start. The novel was given sex.
Richardson had scarcely invented the feminine
novel before Fielding and Smollett were at work
producing books of a masculinity correspondingly
pronounced. Fielding was the first to mark the
difference, and Richardson to the end of his life
hated him for writing <i>Joseph Andrews</i>. It
often happens that one philosopher hates another
whose system though less elaborate is obviously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>founded on a broader basis than his own. Fielding
could afford to laugh at Richardson, but Richardson
could never laugh at Fielding. He could
only enjoy the lesser satisfaction of holding his
rival accursed. Their upbringings had been as
different as the resulting books. Eton, law
studies at Leyden and the Middle Temple, were
a different training for the art of story-telling than
the Dick Whittington youth of the little business
man. Richardson saw the game of life from the
outside. Harry Fielding knew the rough and
tumble. Richardson was all for virtue; so was
Fielding, but, as he would have put it himself,
for virtue that is virtue. Virtue at the expense
of nature he could no more understand than
Benvenuto Cellini, who, if the facts in the case
of Pamela had been set before him, would have
thought her a devilish artful young woman, and,
if he had met her, congratulated her upon her
capture. Fielding had a short, rough and ready
creed, and that was that a good heart goes farther
than a capful of piety towards keeping the world
a habitable place.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pamela</i> and
<i>Joseph
Andrews</i>.</div>

<p><i>Pamela</i> made him laugh. He wanted to make
money by writing, so he sat down to put the laugh
on paper, with the ultimate notion of filling his
pocket by publishing a squib. He set out to
parody Pamela in the person of her brother Mr.
Joseph Andrews. He had not gone very far in
the performance before Parson Adams came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the story, and became so prodigiously delightful
that it occurred to Fielding that he had here as
admirable a couple for adventure as Cervantes
himself could have wished, with the result that
Mr. Andrews' correspondence does not compare
at all favourably with his sister's, while his biography
is infinitely more entertaining. When the
book was done, its creator printed on the title-page:
'Written in imitation of the Manner of
Cervantes, Author of Don Quixote,' made no very
particular reference to his original purpose, and
described his book as 'A Comic Epic in Prose.'
The masculine novel was on its way. Like <i>Don
Quixote</i> or <i>Le Roman Comique</i> it represented a
smiling move towards reality, or the criticism of
reality, in Fielding's hands through the high and
difficult art of ridicule, in the hands of Smollett,
whose first book was published six years later,
through the easier art of caricature.</p>

<p>These two men between them made the masculine
novel of the eighteenth century. Its scope
and character are best mapped out by a study of
their respective lives, which were sufficiently unlike
to make their books almost as different from
each other's as they were from Richardson's.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fielding and
Smollett.</div>

<p>They both looked on man as man, a simple
creature seldom wholly bad. They were not the
fellows to tolerate humbug about platonic love,
or the soul, or religion. Religion meant the
Established Church, and a parson was a man, good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
or bad, a representative of the State perhaps, but
not a representative of God. Love was no opal
passion between Endymion and the moon. It
meant desire between man and woman, as tender
as you liked, but still desire. It was as simple a
thing as valour, which meant ability to use the
fists and stand fire. Fielding and Smollett knew
a fairly brutal world. But their positions in it had
been different. Fielding had always had his head
above water. He is continually thinking of fair
play, and feels, as we do, a thrill at the heart when
he sees Tom Jones and an innkeeper shake hands
after bleeding each other's noses. Smollett had
had a harder time. He had known what it was to
be denied the privileges of a gentleman. He had
been in a subordinate position in the navy when
that was an organisation of licensed brutality.
He was as accustomed to seeing men's bodies
cross-questioned, as Fielding to reading law-cases
and examining men's minds. He writes always
on a more animal level than Fielding. After
every fight he lines up his characters for medical
treatment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">'"'n' well," says he, "'n' how</div>
<div class="i0">Are yer arms, 'n' legs, 'n' liver, 'n' lungs, 'n' bones
a-feelin' now?"'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">Fielding only inquires after their hearts. Put
their portraits side by side, and the difference is
clear. Fielding's is the face of the fortunate man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
who has had his bad times and come smiling
through; Smollett's that of the man not bruised
but permanently scarred by the experiences he
has suffered. An old sailor once said to me
that you can judge of the roughness of a man's
employment by the coarseness of his language;
those whose work is roughest, using the coarsest
words. Fielding is seldom disgusting. His heroes
are constantly putting their feet into it; but not
into unnecessary filth. It is impossible to say
the same of Smollett.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Smollett
and Le Sage.</div>

<p>Their choice of models was characteristic;
<i>Joseph Andrews</i> being written in imitation of
the gentle banter of Cervantes, while <i>Roderick
Random</i> copied the more acid satire of Le Sage.
Indeed, Le Sage was not serious enough. 'The
disgraces of Gil Blas,' says Smollett in his preface,
'are for the most part such as rather excite mirth
than compassion; he himself laughs at them;
and his transitions from distress to happiness, or
at least ease, are so sudden, that neither the
reader has time to pity him, nor himself to
be acquainted with affliction. This conduct, in
my opinion, not only deviates from probability,
but prevents that generous indignation, which
ought to animate the reader against the sordid
and vicious disposition of the world.' That is a
moving and very remarkable paragraph. Between
those lines is the memory of more than enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>'acquaintance with affliction,' and there is something
terrible in the assumption, made with such
absolute conviction, that good luck 'deviates from
probability.' Smollett had not known much happiness,
and found so light-hearted an aim as Le
Sage's impossible. His own was almost vengeful.
'I have attempted to represent modest
merit struggling with every difficulty to which a
friendless orphan is exposed, from his own want
of experience, as well as from the selfishness,
envy, malice, and base indifference of mankind.'
Roderick Random is a rogue and a skunk, but we
cannot blame Tobias Smollett if he did not
know it. Random's more objectionable qualities
are those that pull him through his difficulties.
A nicer man would have gone under. The difficulties
are at fault for making not Random but
Smollett what he was.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
technique
of the
English
novel.</div>

<p>The technique of the English novel was more
elaborate than that of its models. Just as <i>Joseph
Andrews</i> is more orderly than <i>Don Quixote</i>, so
<i>Roderick Random</i> is a step between the pure
rogue novel, the string of adventures only connected
by the person of the adventurer, and the
modern novel of definite plot. <i>Don Quixote</i>
and <i>Gil Blas</i> could be cut off anywhere. Their
creators had only to kill them. But the curtain
could not be rung down on the adventures of
Random or Andrew before quite a number of
different threads had been properly gathered and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>explained. There were a few pretty wild coincidences
to be discovered. Rory, Joseph, and Fanny
all find their true parents; perhaps but rough and
ready means to give rotundity to a story, but still
pleasant mysteries, to be kept like sweetmeats and
dessert as lures for flagging appetites. The novel
had assumed some of the elaborate interest of
the <i>nouvelle</i>, as practised by Cervantes and the
Elizabethans, and the influence of the stage
perhaps partly accounts for the construction of the
English imitations, more consistent than that of
their Spanish and Franco-Spanish models. The
art of play-writing had reached its period of most
scrupulous technique so recently that these two
men who had failed in the theatre were not
likely to forget its methods when experimenting
with the more plastic art of narrative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fielding the
better artist.</div>

<p>Of the two, Fielding is always the better artist.
He is more interested in his art, more single-minded.
He never forgets his duties as a
novelist, and continually turns to the reader, just
as if he were a sculptor executing a difficult piece
of work in the presence of an audience whose
admiration he expects. He was ready to laugh
at himself for it too: 'We assure the reader we
would rather have suffered half mankind to be
hanged than have saved one contrary to the
strictest laws of unity and probability.' He did
not always keep up this admirable conscientiousness;
but he did so more consistently than
Smollett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The delicacy of their craftsmanship is best
compared not in their greatest books but in those
two novels in which they essayed the same task,
the portraiture of a rogue, and a rogue not after
the merry sympathetic fashion of Lazarillo, but
one whom the authors themselves accounted a
villain and expected their readers to detest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Jonathan
Wild.</i></div>

<p>The ironic biographer of Jonathan Wild realised
the difficulties of the undertaking. He saw that
unless he adopted an attitude which would make
it proper for him always to express approval of
his hero, his readers would begin to cast this way
and that, not knowing whether to sympathise or
hate, as the genius of the author or the villainy of
the hero were alternately prominent in their eyes.
Accordingly, choosing the name of a real and
famous gallows-bird who had been hung some
twenty years before, Fielding took his tone from
those little penny biographies that used to be
hawked among the crowd who waited at Tyburn
to see their hero swing. He ironically takes this
tone; and sustains it without a false note for a
couple of hundred pages. How admirably he
uses it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The hero, though he loved the chaste Laetitia with
excessive tenderness, was not of that low snivelling breed of
mortals who, as is generally expressed, <i>tie themselves to a
woman's apron-strings</i>; in a word, who are afflicted with
that mean, base, low vice or virtue, as it is called, of
constancy.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>

And again in the passage that sums up the
book:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'He laid down several maxims, as the certain means of
attaining greatness, to which, in his own pursuit of it, he
constantly adhered.</p>

<p>As&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Never to do more mischief than was necessary to the
effecting of his purpose; for that mischief was too precious
a thing to be thrown away.</p>

<p>2. To know no distinction of men from affection; but to
sacrifice all with equal readiness to his interest.</p>

<p>3. Never to communicate more of an affair than was
necessary to the person who was to execute it.</p>

<p>4. Not to trust him who hath deceived you, nor who
knows he has been deceived by you.</p>

<p>5. To forgive no enemy; but to be cautious and often
dilatory in revenge.</p>

<p>6. To shun poverty and distress, and to ally himself as
close as possible to power and riches.</p>

<p>7. To maintain a constant gravity in his countenance and
behaviour, and to affect wisdom on all occasions.</p>

<p>8. To foment eternal jealousies in his gang, one of
another.</p>

<p>9. Never to reward any one equal to his merit; but always
to insinuate that the reward was above it.</p>

<p>10. That all men were knaves or fools, and much the
greater number a composition of both.</p>

<p>11. That a good name, like money, must be parted with
or at least greatly risked, in order to bring the owner any
advantage.</p>

<p>12. That virtues, like precious stones, were easily counterfeited;
that the counterfeits in both cases adorned the
wearer equally; and that very few had knowledge or discernment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
sufficient to distinguish the counterfeit jewels
from the real.</p>

<p>13. That many men were undone by not going deep
enough in roguery; as in gaming any man may be a loser
who doth not play the whole game.</p>

<p>14. That men proclaim their own virtues, as shopkeepers
expose their goods, in order to profit by them.</p>

<p>15. That the heart was the proper seat of hatred, and the
countenance of affection and friendship.'</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2">The whole scheme is worked out with a scrupulous
attention to the main idea, and a consistency
of mood that would not have been unworthy one
of the self-conscious artists of a hundred years
later. Poe himself could have built no more
skilfully, and, lacking Fielding's knowledge of
rascaldom, the straw for his bricks would not
have been so good.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ferdinand,
Count
Fathom.</i></div>

<p>Smollett had the knowledge; but, a less perspicuous
artist, did not realise the difficulties of
using it. His villain is never frank in his villainy.
Smollett intended from the beginning to disobey
Fielding's principle, meant to save his rogue from
the gallows, meant to do it all along, and was
consequently handicapped in making him respectably
wicked. Ferdinand, Count Fathom, does
damnable deeds, but his author's purpose is completely
nullified by his promise of eventual
conversion. The book is not true to itself, but
fails because Smollett was not sufficient of an
artist to be able to send his hero to hell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>It is interesting to notice in one of the dullest
scenes of this unsatisfactory book, that Smollett
touched for the first time, in a fumbling, hesitant
manner, the note of quasi-supernatural horror
that was soon to be sounded with clarity and
almost too facile skill. In the hero's device for
the undoing of Celinda there is the first warning
of the Radcliffes and Lewises and their kind, with
their groans upon the battlements, their figures in
white, and their unearthly music in the wind.
Smollett did not wait long enough to find out
what could be done with this new sensation. He
jangled the note, and, in his inartistic way, passed
on to paint and to reform the wickedness of the
Count.</p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote">Smollett

versatile.</div>

<p>I am a little ungracious to Smollett in saying
so loud that he was an artist inferior to Fielding.
Inferior he was, but when I set their best books
side by side, I remember that there is little to
choose between the pleasures they have given me,
and am compelled to admit that the less scrupulous
Smollett had the wider range. I read <i>Tom
Jones</i> in one sitting of twenty-four hours, and
should like to write an essay on it, but can find
no excuse for discussing here that epic of good-heartedness,
since its characteristics are not
different from those already noticed in <i>Joseph
Andrews</i>. But <i>Humphry Clinker</i> would have
held me for as long if it had had as many pages,
and in the history of the art, has, as an example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>of the novel in letters, an interest wholly separate
from that of <i>Roderick Random</i>, which is a specimen
of the picaresque. When Smollett came to write
that book he was fifty years old and just about to
die. He seems to have forgotten his old feud
with life, and to look at things with a kindlier
eye as one just ready to depart. His late-won
detachment helped him to a scheme as clear as
one of Fielding's, although even in this he is
sometimes submerged in human nature. His
notion was to describe the same scenes and events
simultaneously from several points of view, in
letters from different persons, so as to keep a
story moving gently forward, with half a dozen
personalities revolving round it, able to realise
themselves or be realised in their own letters or
those of their friends. In none of his other books
are the characters so rounded and complete.
There is Matthew Bramble, the old knight, outwardly
morose and secretly generous; his sister,
an old maid determined not to remain one, for
ever grumbling at her brother's generosities;
Lyddy, their romantic niece, and Jerry, their
young blood of a nephew; and, as persons of the
counterplot, Mistress Winifred Jenkins and Mary
Jones; not to speak of the ubiquitous Clinker.
The letters tell the whole story, and yet, written
long after Richardson's, they have an older manner.
Richardson's letters, with all their passionate reiteration
of detail, do not concern themselves with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
foibles. They do not make you smile at their
writers, and if you had laughed, as Fielding
did, he would have been prodigiously annoyed.
Smollett's letters have the same aim as the letters
of the <i>Spectator</i> or the <i>Tatler</i>. They are different
only in less brilliant polish, and in their grouping
round a story. The Humphry Clinker correspondence
is as important as the letters of Clarissa
in forming the most delicate and humorous epistolary
style employed by Miss Evelina Anville.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The motives
of the
masculine
novel.</div>

<p>The extreme difficulty I have experienced
throughout this chapter in thinking of the technique
of these novelists, instead of their material,
is a tribute to their power. It is the same with
Hogarth. It is impossible to get at the artist
for thinking of the life upon his canvases. It is
almost impossible to consider Fielding or Smollett
as technicians (I have had to do it in their least
human books), for thinking of the England that
they represented. And now that I am looking
about for a concluding paragraph on the work of
these two men, when I should be summing up the
general characteristics of their craftsmanship, I
look at the pile of their books on the table before
me, and feel a full and comfortable stomach, and
cannot get out of my nose the smell of beer and
beef and cheese associated as closely with their
pages as lavender with the pages of <i>Cranford</i>.
What an England it was in their day. Mr.
Staytape carried Rory 'into an alehouse, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
he called for some beer and bread and cheese, on
which we <i>breakfasted</i>.' 'Our landlord and we sat
down at a board, and dined upon a shin of beef
most deliciously; our reckoning amounting to
twopence halfpenny each, bread and small beer
included.' The bright glances of Mistress Waters
'hit only a vast piece of beef which he was carrying
into his plate, and harmless spent their force.'
Her sighs were drowned 'by the coarse bubbling
of some bottled ale.' Square meals are the best
antidotes for sentiment, and in every scene of
these novelists there is always some one who has
fed too recently to allow any hairsplitting delicacy
in the room with him. No confessional disentangling
of emotions, but beer, beef, cheese, a
good heart, a sound skin, and the lack of these
things, are the motives of the masculine novel.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>A NOTE ON STERNE</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Sterne</span> hardly comes within the scope of this book, since his
was the art, not of telling stories, but of withholding them,
not of keeping things on the move, but of keeping them on
the point of moving. It is not without much difficulty
and two or three chapters that a character of Sterne's
crosses the room. The nine books of <i>Tristram Shandy</i>
bring him through the midwife's hands, and a little further.
I believe we hear breeches talked of for him. Another nine
books would perhaps let him put one leg into them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
<i>Tristram Shandy</i> is a continuous denial of the forms that
Fielding and Smollett were doing their best to fix. But it
is read by many who find them superficial, because Sterne
writes of universal, whereas they write of a limited and
particular humanity. They write of a Mr. Jones or a Mr.
Random, while the hero of Sterne's book is man. He
begins, as he puts it himself, <i>ab ovo</i>. He saw that the whole
of humanity is a constellation revolving round the birth of
a child, and contrived to introduce into his book every
imaginable incident connected with that event. If Tristram
Shandy does not grow up quick enough to take to himself a
wife, My Uncle Toby is taken as a husband by the Widow
Wadman. If he does not die, Yorick does. If My Uncle
Toby's affairs do not go far enough to produce a baby,
Tristram is born. In this book, where nothing seems to
happen, everything does. It is the Life and Opinions, not
of Tristram Shandy, but of Humanity, illustrated, not in a
single character over a long period, but in half a dozen over
a short one. For the story of the three generations of the
giants, Rabelais needed land and sea, Paris and Touraine.
For the adventures of his strolling players, Scarron needed a
dozen little towns along the Loire, with inns and ch&acirc;teaux
and what not. But for the adventures of Humanity, Sterne,
who learnt from both of them, needed only a bowling-green,
a study, a bedroom, and a parlour. There is really little else
of background to the story. And it is all there; birth, love,
death, and all the sad comedy of man misunderstood, and
fortunate when, like Uncle Toby, he does not try to understand,
the beginning in triviality, and the end in 'Alas,
poor Yorick!'</p></blockquote>

<h3>CHATEAUBRIAND AND
ROMANTICISM</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Chateaubriand
and
the French
Revolution.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">There</span> are some men who seem epitomes of their
periods, of all the weaknesses, strengths, ideals and
follies and wisdoms of their times. All the tangled
skeins of different movements seem embroidered
into the pattern of a face; and that face is theirs.
We seek in them the years in which they lived,
and are never disappointed. Sir Philip Sidney
means the age of Elizabeth, Dr. Johnson the
common-sense English eighteenth century, Rousseau
the stirring of revolutionary France, Goethe
the awakening of Germany. Of these men was
Chateaubriand. He was born before the storm
and died after it. He gathered up the best of the
things that were before the revolution, and handed
them on to the men who, when the revolution had
left a new France, were to make that new country
the centre of European literature. Rousseau and
the Romantics meet in him. He wrote when
France, her eyes still bright and wide after the
sight of blood, was seeking in religion for one thing,
at least, that might be covered by the tossing waves
of revolution and yet survive. Christianity in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
finest story is the rock on which his lovers break
themselves. And Christianity was the first earthwork
attacked before the revolution, and the first
reoccupied afterwards.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand stands curiously in the midst of
the opposing elements. Like Byron he was a
patrician and a fighter. He too would have died
for freedom. But whereas Byron fought, contemptuously
sometimes, for revolutionaries, Chateaubriand
fought against them.</p>

<p>When some of the ragged ones marched joyously
down his street carrying the heads of two of their
enemies bleeding on the ends of pikes, he cried at
them, 'Brigands! Is this what you mean by
Liberty?' and declared that if he had had a gun
he would have shot them down like wolves. And
if Chateaubriand had not been an aristocrat, he
could never so well have represented his times.
He would have fought and written as a revolutionist,
instead of caring passionately for one party,
and pinning to it the ideals of the other, so claiming
both for his own. Everything that could make
him one with his period and country was his.
After a childhood of severe repression, he had seen
the fall of the Bastille, and then sought liberty
and the North-West Passage, coming back from
America to find the revolution successful against
himself. Could any man's life be so perfect an
analogy of the meteor-like progress of France?
France also sought liberty and a North-West
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Passage, quicker than all others; France also was
to return and find the ground aquiver beneath her
feet.</p>
<div class="illuspage"><a id="rousseau"></a>rousseau</div>

<div class="caption">JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Jean-Jacques
Rousseau.</div>

<p>After that she was to be mistress of Europe.
The three stages of Romanticism correspond with
these three stages of France; the last that of Hugo
and Gautier and Dumas, the Romanticism of 1830,
promised by that of Chateaubriand, itself made
possible by the unrestful writing of Jean-Jacques
Rousseau. It is impossible to understand any one
of the three without referring to the others. Rousseau
was the son of a watchmaker, in a day when
superiority of intellect in a man of low birth won
him either neglect or the most insufferable patronage.
His mother died in bearing him, and his
father, although he made a second marriage, never
mentioned her without tears. He seems to have
been a very simple-hearted man, and found such
pleasure in romances that he would sit up all night
reading them to his little son, going ashamedly to
bed in the morning when the swallows began to
call in the eaves. These two traits in his father
are characteristic of the work of Rousseau himself.
His life was spent in emphasising the compatibility
of low birth with lofty animation, and so in preparing
that democratisation of literature that
generously attributes humanity to men who are
not gentlemen. Richardson gave him a suitable
narrative form for what he had to say, and <i>La
Nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</i> is a novel in letters whose hero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
is a poor tutor in love with his pupil. The book
is full of an emotional oratory so fresh and sincere
that it seems as if the ice of fifty years of passionless
reasoning has suddenly broken over the springs
of the human heart. There is in it too an Ossianic
sharing of feelings with Nature, as if man had
realised with the tears in his eyes that he had not
always lived in towns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The world
of the
Revolution.</div>

<p>Chateaubriand had not Rousseau's birthright of
handicap. He could not feel the righteous energy
of the watchmaker's son against a people who did
not know their own language and were yet in a
position to employ him as a footman. He was
outside that quarrel. He left Rousseau's social
reform behind him on the threshold of his world,
but had learnt from him to carry his heart upon
his sleeve, and to cry, like <i>Ossian</i>, 'The murmur
of thy streams, O Lara! brings back the memory
of the past. The sound of thy woods, Garmallar,
is lovely in mine ear.' He took with him Rousseau's
twin worships of passion and nature into
the melancholy turmoil that was waiting for him,
sad with an unrest not of classes but of a nation.
He knew, like France, what it was to question
everything while standing firm upon nothing. In
that maelstrom nothing seemed fixed; there was
nothing a man might grasp for a moment to keep
his head above the waters of infinite doubt. Everything
seemed possible, and much of the Romantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
melancholy is a despairing cry for a little impossibility
from which at least there could be no
escape. It is one thing to question religion by the
light of atheism, or atheism by the light of religion;
it is another thing, and far more terrible, to question
both while sure of neither, and to see not one
word in all the universe, not God, nor Man, nor
State, nor Church, without a question mark at its
side, a ghastly reminder of uncertainty, like, in
some old engravings, the waiting figure of Death
muffled in each man's shadow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Atala.</i></div>

<p>That was the world of the Revolution, a world
whose permanent instability had been suddenly
made manifest by a violent removal of the apparently
stable crust. With the overturning of one
mountain every other shuddered in its bed, and
seemed ready at any moment to shake with crash
and groan into the valleys. This was the world
for whose expression the face of Chateaubriand,
nervous, passionate, the fire of vision in his eye,
the wind of chaos in his tempestuous hair, seems
so marvellously made. This was the world in
which, like the spirit of his age, he wrote the
books the times expected because they were
their own. <i>Atala</i> and <i>Ren&eacute;</i>, but particularly
<i>Atala</i>, seemed to be the old, vague promises
of Rousseau and <i>Ossian</i>, reaffirmed with the
clarity of a silver trumpet. Chactas and Atala,
those savage lovers, who 'took their way towards
the star that never moves, guiding their steps by
the moss on the tree stems,' walked like young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
deities of light before these people who had known
the half-mummied courtesies of an eighteenth
century civilisation. 'She made him a cloak of
the inner bark of the ash, and mocassins of the
musk rat's skin, and he set on her head a wreath
of blue mallows, and on her neck red berries of
the azalea, smiling as he did so to see how fair she
was.' The world is young again, and man has won
his way back into Eden, conscious of sorrow, conscious
of evil, but alive and unafraid to be himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature and
emotion.</div>

<p>Chateaubriand carried further than Rousseau
the transfiguration of nature by emotion, although
in <i>Atala</i> nature is still a stage effect, subjected to
its uses as illustration of the feelings of the humans
in the tale. Chateaubriand tunes up the elements
with crash of thunder, bright forked lightning,
and fall of mighty tree, to the moment when, in
the supreme crisis the hand of Atala's God intervenes
between the lovers, and the bell of the
forest hermitage sounds in the appropriate silence.
But in those vivid, fiery descriptions there is
already something besides the theatrical, a new
generosity of sentiment that was to let Barye
make lions and tigers instead of what would once
have been rather impersonal decorations, and to
allow Corot to give landscapes their own personality
without always seeking to impose on them the
irrelevant interest of human figures. Nature is
never excluded from the story, and when the
action is less urgent the setting is given a greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>freedom. The lovers never meet on a studio
background, but are always seen with trees and
rivers, and forest dawn and forest night, more real
than any that had been painted before. Chateaubriand
is never content to call a tree a tree or a
bird a bird, but gives them the dignity of their
own names. Aurora no longer rises from her rosy
bed in the approved convention for the dawn, but
a bar of gold shapes itself in the east, the sparrow-hawks
call from the rocks, and the martens retire
to the hollows of the elms.</p>
<div class="illuspage"><a id="chateaubriand"></a>chateaubriand</div>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">FRAN&Ccedil;OIS REN&Eacute; DE CHATEAUBRIAND</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Particularity
in setting.</div>

<p>It was through caring for his setting in this
way that Chateaubriand came as if by accident to
the discovery of local colour. He wanted his
savages to love in the wilderness, and happening
to have seen a wilderness, reproduced it, and made
his savages not merely savages but Muskogees,
fashioned their talk to fit their race, and made it
quite clear that this tale, at any rate, could not
be imagined as passing on the Mountains of the
Moon. When the older story-tellers named a
locality they did little more than the Elizabethan
stage managers, who placed a label on the stage
and expected it to be sufficient to conjure up a
forest or a battlefield. Chateaubriand, in making
his writing more completely pictorial, visualised
his scenes in detail, and so showed the Romantics
the way to that close distinction between country
and country, age and age, race and race, that
made the artists of the nineteenth century richer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
than any who were before them in variety of subject,
and in the material of self-expression.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christianity.</div>

<p>The Christianity of <i>Atala</i> was the religion that
Chateaubriand offered to his country in <i>Le G&eacute;nie
du Christianisme</i>. I can never be quite sure that
it was his own, but in that amazing book, divided
and subdivided like an ancient treatise on some
occult science, he showed with passionate use of
reasoning and erudition that Christianity was not
the ugly thing that it had been pictured by
the eighteenth century philosophers, and, more,
that it at least was older than France, and permanent
in a world where kings, emperors, and
republics swung hither and thither like dead
leaves in the wind. The teaching came to Paris
like a gospel. These people, anchorless as they
were, were not difficult converts, because they
were eager to be converted, and to be able, if only
for a moment in their lives, to whisper, 'I believe'
in something other than uncertainty. All society
became Christian for a time, and when that time
passed, the effects of the book did not all pass with
it. The artists of a younger generation had
learned that Christianity was the belief that had
brought most loveliness into the world, and that
the Gods of Antiquity were not the only deities
who were favourable to beautiful things. The
false taste of the end of the eighteenth century
had been pierced by Gothic spires, and through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>the dull cloud of correct and half-hearted imitation
showed again the pinnacles and gargoyles and
flying buttresses of the na&iuml;ve and trustful medi&aelig;val
art. Atala joins hands with Nicolete, and links
Victor Hugo with the builders of Notre Dame.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The art
of Chateaubriand
survives
the
battle in
which it
was used.</div>

<p>There is little wonder that a writer who
answered so fully the needs of his own generation,
and did so much to cut a way for the generation
to come, became instantly famous, immediately
execrated. Chateaubriand wrote: 'La pol&eacute;mique
est mon allure naturelle.... Il me faut toujours
un adversaire, n'importe o&ugrave;.' In 1800 he had no
difficulty in finding them. But it takes two to
make a quarrel. It would not have been surprising
if books that belonged so absolutely to the battles
of their times should have struck their blows,
and been then forgotten for want of opposition.
Manifestations of the time spirit, and particularly
fighting manifestations, not infrequently manifest
it only to the time, and are worthless to future
generations. <i>Atala</i>, after setting in an uproar the
Paris of 1802 is for us but a beautiful piece of
colour whose pattern has faded away. Unless we
can feel with the men of the dawn that we are
tossing on mad waves, clutching at religion as at
a rock beneath the shifting waters, and breathlessly
thankful for any proof of its steadfastness and
power: unless we can remember with them the
old love of drawing-rooms and bent knees and
kisses on gloved hands, and feel with them a
passionate novelty in the love of wild things in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
open air; unless we can remember the tamed,
docile nature of the pastorals, and open our eyes
upon a first view of any sort of real country;
unless, in a word, we can dream back a hundred
years, the beauty of <i>Atala</i> is like that of an old
battle-cry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'So he cried, as the fight grew thick at the noon,</div>
<div class="i0"><i>Two red roses across the moon</i>!'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">The cry no longer calls to battle. The combatants
are dead. The bugle sounds to armies of white
bones, and we who overhear it think only of the
skill of the trumpeter. And Chateaubriand had
something in him that was independent of his
doctrines, independent of his enemies. Flaubert,
looking back to him over the years, saw in his
books, when the dust of their battles settled
about them, early examples of a most scrupulous
technique. Chateaubriand the fighter, the man
of his time, was forgotten in the old master of
a new prose. These books shaped in the din of
battle were models for men writing in a fat, quiet
day of peace. Then it was possible, the clangour
no longer sounding in the ears, to notice the
mastery of form, the elaboration, carried so far and
no further, of the main idea into the significant
detail that was to make the idea alive; then
became clear the economy that makes of every
fact a vivid illustration of some trait in the people
of the story, a heightening of the lights or a
deepening of the shadows of the tale.</p>

<h3>SCOTT AND ROMANTICISM</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Scott's place
in the
romantic
movement.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> genius of a man like Scott does not leap into
the world a complete and novel creation, like
Minerva from the skull of Jupiter, ready for
battle, and accoutred in the armour that it never
afterwards forsakes. Nor does it with the strength
of its own hand turn one world into another, or
the audience of Fielding and Smollett into that of
the Waverley Novels. The world is prepared for
it; it finds its weapons lying round its cradle, and
works its miracle with the world's co-operation.</p>

<p>Romanticism, although, in our indolence, we
like to think of it as the work of a single man, as
a stream gushing from the hard rock at the stroke
of a Moses, was no conjuring trick, nor sudden
invention, but a force as old as story-telling. The
rock had been built gradually over it, and was as
gradually taken away. It suits our convenience
and the pictorial inclination of our minds to
imagine it as the work of one man or two; but
there is hardly need to remind ourselves of facts
we have so wilfully forgotten, and that, if we
choose, we can trace without difficulty a more
diffuse as well as a more ancient origin of the
spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Romanticism was a movement too large and
too various to be defined in a paragraph, or to
allow an essay on any single man to describe,
even in the art of story-telling, its several sources,
and the innumerable streams that flowed from
them to fertilise the nineteenth century. It
carried with it liberty and toleration, liberty of
expression and toleration of all kinds of spiritual
and physical vitality. It was comparable with
and related to the French Revolution. It allowed
men to see each other in their relations with the
universe as well as with each other, and made
existence a thing about which it was possible to
be infinitely curious. Old desires for terror and
fantasy and magnificence arose in the most
civilised of minds. Glamour was thrown over the
forest and the palace, and the modern and ancient
worlds came suddenly together, so that all the
ages seemed to be contemporary and all conditions
of human life simultaneous and full of
promise.</p>

<p>Scott was a part of this revivified world, and
his importance in it is not that of its inventor, but
of the man who brought so many of its qualities
into the art of story-telling that his novels became
a secondary inspiration, and moved men as
different as Hugo, Balzac, and Dumas, to express
themselves in narrative.</p>

<div class="caption">SIR WALTER SCOTT</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Romanticism
before the
Waverley
Novels.</div>

<p>Before the writing of the Waverley Novels,
Romanticism in English narrative had shown itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>but a stuttering and one-legged abortion, remarkable
only for its extravagances. It had not,
except in poetry, been humane enough to be
literature. It had made only violent gesticulations
like a man shut up in a sack.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole, protesting, I suppose, against
Fielding and Smollett, had said that the 'great
resources of fancy had been dammed up by a
strict adherence to common life,' while the older
romances were 'all imagination and improbability.'
He had tried to combine the two in <i>The
Castle of Otranto</i>, a book in which portraits sigh
and step down from their canvases, dead hermits
reappear as skeletons in sackcloth, and gigantic
ghosts in armour rise to heaven in a clap of
thunder. These eccentricities were efforts after
the strangeness of all true romance, and their
instant popularity showed how ready people were
for mystery and ancient tale. Before Scott
succeeded in doing what Walpole had attempted,
in writing a tale that should be strange but sane,
ancient but real, a crowd of novels, whose most
attractive quality was their 'horridness,' had
turned the heads of the young women who read
them. Miss Thorpe, in <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'My dearest Catherine, what have you been doing with
yourself all this morning? Have you gone on with
<i>Udolpho</i>?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I have been reading it ever since I woke; and I am
got to the black veil.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
'Are you indeed? How delightful! Oh! I would not
tell you what is behind the black veil for the world! Are
not you wild to know?'</p>

<p>'Oh! yes, quite; what can it be? But do not tell me:
I would not be told upon any account. I know it must be a
skeleton; I am sure it is Laurentina's skeleton. Oh! I am
delighted with the book! I should like to spend my whole
life in reading it, I assure you; if it had not been to meet
you, I would not have come away from it for all the world.'</p>

<p>'Dear creature, how much I am obliged to you; and
when you have finished <i>Udolpho</i>, we will read the Italian
together; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more
of the same kind for you.'</p>

<p>'Have you indeed! How glad I am! What are they
all?'</p>

<p>'I will read you their names directly; here they are in my
pocket-book. <i>Castle of Wolfenbach</i>, <i>Clermont</i>, <i>Mysterious
Warnings</i>, <i>Necromancer of the Black Forest</i>, <i>Midnight
Bell</i>, <i>Orphan of the Rhine</i>, and <i>Horrid Mysteries</i>. These
will last us some time.'</p>

<p>'Yes; pretty well; but are they all horrid? Are you
sure they are all horrid?'</p>

<p>'Yes, quite sure, for a particular friend of mine, a Miss
Andrews, a sweet girl, one of the sweetest creatures in the
world, has read every one of them. I wish you knew Miss
Andrews, you would be delighted with her. She is netting
herself the sweetest cloak you can imagine.'</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Percy,
<i>Ossian</i>, and
Chatterton.</div>

<p>These things were but the clothes of romantic
story-telling, walking bodiless about the world,
while a poetry old enough to be astonishingly
new was nurturing the body that was to stretch
them for itself. Chatterton's ballads, imitations
as they were, showed a sudden and novel feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
for medi&aelig;val colouring. <i>Ossian</i>, that book of
majestic moments, carried imagination out again
to stand between the wind and the hill. Scott
disliked its vagueness, but it helped in preparing
his world. Percy's <i>Reliques</i>, excused by their
compiler on the frivolous ground of antiquarian
interest, brought the rough voice and rude style
of Sir Philip Sidney's blind beggar ringing across
the centuries, and in those old tales, whose rhymes
clash like sword on targe, Scott found the inspiration
that Macpherson's disorderly, splendid flood
swept down on other men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scott's life.</div>

<p>Scott's life was no patchwork but woven on
a single loom. He did not turn suddenly in
manhood to discover the colour of his life. It
had been his in babyhood. An old clergyman,
a friend of his aunt, protested that 'one may as
well speak in the mouth of a cannon as where
that child is,' while Walter Scott, aged three or
four, shouted the ballad of Hardyknute:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'And he has ridden o'er muir and moss,</div>
<div class="i2">O'er hills and mony a glen,</div>
<div class="i0">When he came to a wounded knight</div>
<div class="i2">Making a heavy mane.</div>
<div class="i0">Here maun I lye, here maun I dye,</div>
<div class="i2">By treacherie's false guiles;</div>
<div class="i0">Witless I was that e'er gave faith</div>
<div class="i2">To wicked woman's smiles.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As he grew older, he was able, like Froissart,
to 'inquire of the truth of the deeds of war and
adventures' that were to be the background of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
much of his work. He knew old Lowland gentlemen
who had paid blackmail to Rob Roy, was
told of the '15 and the '45 by veterans who had
used their swords on those occasions, and heard
of the executions after Culloden from one who
had seen at Carlisle the rebels' heads above the
Scottish Gate. The warlike knowledge of his
childhood was ripened and mellowed for story-telling
by the enthusiasms of his youth. Riding
through the Lowland valleys collecting the
border minstrelsy, his good nature and pleasant
way let him learn in a broad acquaintanceship
fashion the character of his countrymen. He
had not Balzac's deep-cutting analytic knowledge
of men, but knew them as a warm-hearted fellow
of themselves. He knew them as one man knows
another, and not with the passionately speculative
knowledge belonging to a mind that contemplates
them from another world. He did not analyse
them, but wrote of their doings with an unconscious
externality that very much simplified their
motives and made them fit participators in the
sportsman-like life of his books.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scott and
reality.</div>

<p>Ballads and sagas and the historical reading to
which they had given their savour; a free open
air life, and a broad, humorous understanding of
men; these were the things that Scott had behind
him when Cervantes moved him to write narrative,
and when the gold that shines through the dress
of education in the stories of Maria Edgeworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
made him fall in love with local as well as
historical colour, anxious to draw his nation as
she had drawn hers, and to paint Scottish character
in prose as Burns had painted it in verse.
The historical character of his work should not
disguise from us its more vital qualities. Hazlitt,
whose keen eye was not to be put out by the gold
and pomp of trappings and armour, notices that
Scott represents a return to the real. He is
noticing the most invigorating quality of Romanticism.
Scott's importance is not his because he
wrote historical novels, but because his historical
novels were humane. He had found out, as
Hazlitt says, that 'there is no romance like the
romance of real life.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
technique.</div>

<p>'As for his technique, there is no need to praise
him, who had so many other virtues, for that of
delicate craftsmanship, which he had not. He
was not a clever performer, but an honest one
whose methods were no more elaborate than himself.
Dumas describes them in that chapter of
the <i>Histoire de mes B&ecirc;tes</i> in which he discusses
his own:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'His plan was to be tedious, mortally tedious, often for
half a volume, sometimes for a volume.</p>

<p>'But during this volume he posed his characters; during
this volume he made so minute a description of their
physiques, characters, and habits; you learnt so well how
they dressed, how they walked, how they talked, that when,
at the beginning of the second volume, one of these characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
found himself in some danger, you exclaimed to
yourself:</p>

<p>'"What, that poor gentleman in an applegreen coat,
who limped as he walked, and lisped as he talked, how is
he going to get out of that?"</p>

<p>'And you were very much astonished, after being bored
for half a volume, a volume, sometimes indeed for a volume
and a half; you were astonished to find that you were
enormously concerned for the gentleman who lisped in
talking, limped in walking, and had an applegreen coat.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The sensation of reading a Waverley Novel is
that of leaning on the parapet of a bridge on
a summer day, watching the sunlight on a twig
that lies motionless in a backwater. The day
is so calm and the sunlight so pleasant that we
continue watching the twig for a time quite
disproportionate to the interest we feel in it,
until, when it is at last carried into the main
current, we follow its swirling progress down
the stream, and are no more able to take our eyes
from it than if we were watching the drowning of
ourselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Improvisation.</div>

<p>Scott knew very well the disadvantages of improvisation,
of piling up his interest and our own
together. But he could work in no other manner.
He said: 'There is one way to give novelty, to
depend for success on the interest of a well contrived
story. But, wo's me! that requires thought,
consideration&mdash;the writing out of a regular plan or
plot&mdash;above all, the adhering to one, which I can
never do, for the ideas rise as I write, and bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
such a disproportioned extent to that which each
occupied at the first concoction, that (cocksnowns!)
I shall never be able to take the trouble.' His was
a mind entirely different from Poe's, or M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's,
or Flaubert's, those scrupulous technicians with
whom was the future of Romanticism, and it was an
artistic virtue in him to realise the fact, to proceed
on his own course, leaving as he went large, rough,
incomparable things, as impressive as the boulder
stones of which the country people say that a giant
threw them as he passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
character
and work.</div>

<p>His swift, confused writing gets its effect because
he never asked too much from it. He never tried
to do anything with it beyond the description of
his characters and the telling of their story. He
had no need to catch an atmosphere by subtleties
of language. His conception of the beings and
life of another age did not make them different
except in externals, from our own. He did not,
like Gautier or Flaubert, regard the past as a
miraculous time in which it was possible to be
oneself, or in which true feeling was not veiled in
inexactitudes. Very simple himself, he did not
feel in the present those laxities of sensation or
inexactitudes of expression that made the past a
place of refuge. He was not dissatisfied with life
as he found it, and was not disposed to alter it
when he dressed it for a masquerade. Nor was
that difficult for him. His mind was full of the
stage properties of the past, and, as he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
about, he lived in any time he chose and was the
same in all of them. He lived with humanity
rather than in any particular half-century, and did
not feel, like Peacock, the need of dainty, careful
movement in order not to break the fabric he was
building. <i>Maid Marian</i> is the same story as
<i>Ivanhoe</i>. Scott seems to have stepped straight
out of his story to write it, Peacock to be looking
a long way back, and building very skilfully the
replica of something he had never seen but in
a peculiarly happy vision. Scott is quite at home
in his tale, and can treat it as rudely as he likes.
Peacock seems to be playing very warily on the
fragile keys of a spinet.</p>

<p>Sir Walter's fingers would have broken a spinet.
His was no elaborately patterned music threaded
with the light delicacies of melody. He struck
big chords and used the loud pedal. His was the
art of a Wagner rather than that of a Scarlatti.
'The Big Bow-wow strain,' he wrote, comparing
himself with Jane Austen, 'I can do like any now
going; but the exquisite touch, which renders
ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting,
from the truth of the description and the
sentiment, is denied to me.' 'One man can do but
one thing. Universal pretensions end in nothing.'
Scott knew that jewellery-work was not for him,
and never tried his eyes by peering through the
watchmaker's glass. He saw life, as a short-sighted
man sees a landscape, in its essentials. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
spread over it what dress of detail he preferred, and
chose that which came readiest to his hand, flinging
over humanity the cloak of his boyish dreams.
Humanity was not hampered by it, but moves
through his pages like a stout wind over a northern
moor.</p>

<h2>THE ROMANTICISM OF 1830</h2>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE ROMANTICISM OF 1830</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The
mingling
of the arts.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Dumas</span> in <i>La Femme au Collier de Velours</i> thus
describes Hoffmann's room: 'It was the room
of a genius at once capricious and picturesque,
for it had the air of a studio, a music-shop, and a
study, all together. There was a palette, brushes,
and an easel, and on the easel the beginnings of a
sketch. There was a guitar, a violin, and a piano,
and on the piano an open sonata. There was
pen, ink, and paper, and on the paper the first
scrawled lines of a ballad. Along the walls were
bows, arrows, and arbalests of the fifteenth century,
sixteenth-century drawings, seventeenth-century
musical instruments, chests of all times, tankards
of all shapes, jugs of all kinds, and, lastly, glass
necklaces, feather fans, stuffed lizards, dried
flowers, a whole world of things, but a whole
world not worth twenty-five silver thalers.'</p>

<p>That account, whether from hearsay, conjecture,
or knowledge, I do not know, is not only an
admirable portrait of the room and brain of an
arch-romantic, but might serve as a parable of
the Romanticism of 1830. In that year Hugo's
<i>Hernani</i> was produced at the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and the young men who battled with the Philistines
for its success were drawn from the studios as well
as from the libraries, and had their David in
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier. Never before had the arts
been so inextricably entangled, had antiquarianism
been so lively and humane, had gems and
worthless baubles been so confounded together.
Chateaubriand had reaffirmed the pictorial rights
of literature. Delacroix was painting pictures
from Byron and from Dante, in bold, predominant
colours, very different from the lassitudinous
livery of the schools. There was a new
generosity of sentiment responsible for Corot's
landscapes and Barye's beasts. The sudden
widening of knowledge and sympathy was expressed
in the new broadness and courage of
technique, and the same forces that covered the
palette with vivid reds and blues, and compelled
the sculptor to a virile handling of his chisel, found
outlet in words also. Writers, like painters,
seized the human, coloured, passionate elements
in foreign literatures, looking everywhere for the
liberty and brilliance they desired. The open-throated,
sinewy, gladiatorial muse of Byron
found here devoted worshippers, and the spacious
movements of Shakespeare, his people alive and
free, independent of the dramas in which for a
few hours in the Globe Theatre they had had a
part to play, delighted men with an outlook very
different from, and hostile to, that of Voltaire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>although he had done his share in making their
outlook possible.</p>
<div class="illuspage"><a id="hugo"></a>hugo</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_202f.jpg" width="400" height="616" alt="" />
<div class="caption">VICTOR HUGO</div>
</div>
<p>The studio and the study were very close
together. Gautier, Hugo, and M&eacute;rim&eacute;e were all
painters in their own right, and there is a difference
between the writers who have only seen life
from a library, and those who have seen it from
behind an easel. The writer who has once felt
them can never forget the eye-delighting pleasures
of the palette, but composes in colour-schemes,
and feels for the tints of words as well as for
their melody. The work of the Romantics was
visualised and coloured in a manner then new.
It was almost shocking to men who had been
accustomed, as it were, to write in the severest
monotone, and to refuse, if indeed they had ever
thought of it, such luxury of realisation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Local colour.</div>

<p>There is no need, except for the sake of the
argument, to state the fact that pictures are called
up in a reader's mind by a careful selection of
details presented in a proper order. It is well
known that a few details correctly chosen have a
more compelling power on the imagination than a
complete and catalogued description. These men,
writing pictorially, gave a new responsibility to
single touches. It became clear that visualisation
was impossible unless observation preceded it,
and details accordingly took upon themselves the
exigent dignity of local colour. Local colour,
from distinguishing between places, was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to mark the difference between times. Arch&aelig;ology
became suddenly of absorbing interest; its
materials were more than its materials; they were
made the symbols of lives as real and as red in the
veins as those of the arch&aelig;ologists themselves.
Notre Dame was no longer to be expressed in a
learned antiquarian paper, but in a passionate
book. And Victor Hugo visualising with the
accuracy of a poet, found that just as arch&aelig;ology
meant little without life, so the life was vapid
without the arch&aelig;ology. Quasimodo shoves his
hideous face through a hole in order to be elected
king of fools, but Hugo does not allow that
marvellous grimace to fill the picture. The hole
must be there as well, and so 'une vitre bris&eacute;e &agrave; la
jolie rosace audessus de la porte laissa libre un
cercle de pierre par lequel il fut convenu que les
concurrents passeraient la t&ecirc;te.' The setting is as
important as the head; humanity and its trappings
are worthless by themselves, and valuable
only together. Here is the source of Realism,
within Romanticism itself. Indeed almost the
whole development of the art in the nineteenth
century is due to this new care for the frame, and
to this new honesty in dealing with the man within
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The youth
of the
Romantics.</div>

<p>An energetic simplicity of nature was needed
for the fullest enjoyment of these new conditions,
and the greatest of the French Romantics were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>almost like big interested children in their attitude
towards life and themselves. As soon as
we find a Romantic like M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, reserved, subtle,
a tender-hearted Machiavellian, we find a man
who is to dissociate himself from them sooner or
later, and to produce something different a little
from the purely Romantic ideals. There is something
beautiful and inspiriting in the youth of the
Romantics. I like to think of Gautier, the olive-skinned
boy from the studio in the rue St. Louis,
overcome with nervousness at the idea of touching
the hand of Hugo, himself only twenty-seven,
sitting down and trembling like a girl on the
stairs before the master's door. And then the
splendid prank of Dumas, who, on the eve of
revolution, went down into the country like one
of his own heroes, held up a town, and with a
very few friends obtained the submission of the
governor, and captured an arsenal for his party.
They were boys, and some hostility was needed for
their uttermost delight. In England the battles
of art are more like squabbles, but in the Paris
of 1830 it seemed as if the town were divided into
camps for the defence of classicism and the support
of the new ideas. It was as if each point of
vantage had to be taken by storm, and the great
night of <i>Hernani</i>, when Hugo's supporters had red
tickets and a password&mdash;the Spanish word <i>hierro</i>,
which means 'steel'&mdash;was the noblest memory in
the life of at least one of Hugo's enthusiastic
lieutenants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>

Such a joyous and vigorous thing was the
Romanticism of 1830. It touched story-telling
through Balzac, Hugo, Dumas, Gautier, and
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, of whom the first three, in turning from
the theatre to the art of narrative, found inspiration
in Sir Walter Scott. Scott's influence has been
one of bulk rather than of quality on English
story-telling. But in France, instead of tracing
his progeny in insipid copies, we follow it through
the bold variations of these three powerful and
original minds. Through them it returned to
England again. Balzac, as the most important of
the three, in view of the later developments of
the novel, I have discussed in a separate chapter.
Gautier's Oriental and Antique inspiration, and
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's combination of ascetic narrative with
vivid subject, are also themes for separate and
particular consideration. But Hugo and Dumas
are so generally representative of the Romantic
movement in story-telling, that in writing of them
in this chapter I feel I am but filling in the background
already sketched for the others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Preface
to <i>Cromwell</i>.</div>

<p>The theatre was, in 1830, the scene of the most
decisive battle between Romanticism and Classicism.
The fight of the painters, of the poets, of
the story-tellers, seemed concentrated in the more
obvious combat of the dramatists, whose armies
could see their enemies, and even come to blows
with them. And in Hugo's preface to <i>Cromwell</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>that preface which is now so much more interesting
than the play that follows it, he claims several
things for the dramatist that by act if not by
argument he was later to claim for the artist in
narrative. He demands that the sublime and
ridiculous should be together in literature and, as in
life, win their force from each other. The drama,
and so the novel, which also attempts in some sort
a reproduction of human existence, is not to be
written on a single note. It is not to be wholly
sublime or wholly ridiculous, but both at once.
The general in his triumphal car is to be genuinely
afraid of toppling over. And so, in <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables</i>,
the student's frolic is whole-heartedly described,
without in any way binding the author to make
light of the sorrow of Fantine when she finds that
her own desertion is the merry surprise at the end
of it. The sublime will not be the less sublime for
being mingled with the grotesque, and so, in <i>Notre
Dame de Paris</i>, the deepest passion in the book is
felt by a hideous and deformed dwarf, and by this
same dwarf rather than by any more obvious
impersonation of justice, the lascivious priest is
flung from the tower. Looking up in his agony,
as he clings to the bending cornice his desperate
hands have clutched, he does not meet the eyes
of some person of a grandeur matching the moment,
but sees the grotesque face of Quasimodo,
utterly indifferent to him, looking, like one of the
gargoyles, over Paris, with tears on his distorted
cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>

In this same preface, too, Hugo justifies innovations
in language, very necessary for an art whose
new won freedom was to let it explore so much
that was unknown. When the body changes, he
asks, would you keep the coat the same? Triumphantly
appealing to history, he points out that
'the language of Montaigne is no longer that of
Rabelais, the language of Pascal is no longer that
of Montaigne, and the language of Montesquieu
is no longer that of Pascal.' He is justifying
there the coloured prose of Chateaubriand, the
opulent vocabulary of Gautier, and his own infinitely
various effects in prose and verse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Victor Hugo
on Scott.</div>

<p>He was, until Sainte-Beuve took the work from
his hands, at once the leader and the defender of
Romanticism. And, critic and artist, severally
and in the combination that we have grown
accustomed to expect in fulfilment of both these
functions, his was too sovereign a mind to adopt
or borrow anything from another writer without
knowing very clearly what he intended to do with
it. Writing of <i>Quentin Durward</i>, he said:
'Apr&egrave;s le roman pittoresque mais prosa&iuml;que de
Walter Scott il restera un autre roman &agrave; cr&eacute;er,
plus beau et plus complet encore selon nous.
C'est le roman, &agrave; la fois drame et &eacute;pop&eacute;e, pittoresque
mais po&egrave;tique, r&eacute;el mais id&eacute;al, vrai mais
grand, qui ench&acirc;ssera Walter Scott dans Hom&egrave;re.'
That romance is Victor Hugo's own. His tremendous
books are conceived in the manner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
an epic poet rather than of a novelist or a
romancer. The relations of his characters are
not solely concerned with themselves but with
some large principle that animates the book in
which they live. If he is without Norns or Fates,
if he sets his characters against a background
other than that of Destiny, he substitutes the
power of the law or the power of the sea, and
illumines with a story not only the actors who
take part in it, but also the spirit of the Gothic
or the spirit of revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Waverley
Novels and
Hugo's
romances.</div>

<p>To turn from the Waverley Novels to the romances
of Hugo, is like stepping from the open air
into a vast amphitheatre whose enclosed immensity
is more overwhelming than the clear sky. Scott
writes, on a plain human level, tales that we can
readily believe, chronicles that are like private
documents, or memoirs such as might have been
written by the ancestors of our own families.
Hugo does not tell his tale from the point of view
of its actors, but puts them before us in a setting
far larger than the one they saw. Their petty
adventures are but threads chosen arbitrarily from
a far more intricate design, and they themselves
but illustrations of some greater motion than any
to which in their own right they could aspire.
There are hundreds of them, and with our narrow
powers of interest and attention we fasten on one
or two, like children choosing colours on a race-course,
and follow them to the end, while Hugo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
with his godlike eye, sees them all as threads in
his pattern, poor, small lives, twisted in accordance
with a design beyond their comprehension. In
Scott's open air we can live and breathe and be
content, and stand firmly with our feet upon the
ground. In Hugo's amphitheatre we see an
ordered spectacle of life and death, and are,
as it were, present at the shapings of the ends of
man.</p>

<div class="caption">ALEXANDRE DUMAS</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dumas on
Scott.</div>

<p>There is a much less terrible pleasure to be had
from the works of Dumas. Behind all Hugo's
books is the solemnity, behind Dumas' the joy
of living, the <i>joie de vivre</i>&mdash;the French phrase,
although identical, seems better to express it.
To compare Hugo's with Dumas' criticism of the
Scott novel is to see very clearly the difference in
weight and depth between the two men. Hugo
sees in Scott the promise of another and a greater
kind of romance. Dumas sees only that it is
possible to improve on Scott's technique. He
notices that Scott spends half a volume or so in
describing his characters before setting them in
action, and in his gay way justifies him by saying:
'Il n'y a pas de feu sans fum&eacute;e, il n'y a pas de
soleil sans ombre. L'ennui, c'est l'ombre; l'ennui
c'est la fum&eacute;e.' Sacrifice fifty pages of <i>ennui</i> to
the gods, and then away with your story. Dumas
decides to improve on this, to set his characters
moving, and to pour his libations of <i>ennui</i> on the
way. 'Commencer par l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t, au lieu de commencer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>par l'ennui; commencer par l'action, au
lieu de commencer par la pr&eacute;paration; parler des
personnages apr&egrave;s les avoir fait para&icirc;tre, au lieu de
les faire para&icirc;tre apr&egrave;s avoir parl&eacute; d'eux.' This is
not very sublime, after the suggestion that Hugo
won from the same subject; but it produced '<i>Les
Trois Mousquetaires</i>.' D'Artagnan is in a hubbub
on the first page, and the <i>ennui</i> of description
is given us so sparsely that, watching for it chapter
by chapter, we almost consider ourselves swindled
when we reach the last and are still without it.
'The purpose of this tale is not to describe interiors,'
Dumas petulantly ejaculates when tired of talking
about Cornelius' room in <i>La Tulipe Noire</i>. No;
certainly not; neither of rooms nor of men. Damn
psychology, and hey for full-blooded adventure.
Dumas took a free stage for his duels and headlong
rides and gallant adventures and ingenious stratagems.
His men moved too fast not to feel themselves
encumbered in a furnished room; there was
little point in describing a landscape for them, since,
before it was done, they were several leagues off
in another; too intricate furniture in their own
heads would have cost them hesitancies, unguarded
stabs, and possible falls from a galloping horse.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Les Trois
Mousquetaires.</i></div>

<p>Dumas' novels are novels of the theatre. His
first piece of work was an attempt to make a
melodrama out of <i>Ivanhoe</i>, and his best books
exhibit the art of Walter Scott modified by the
rules of the stage. The curtain rises on people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
moving about. It falls on a climax. The action
of all its scenes is in crescendo. Alter Scott to fit
these rules, and you have something like the
form that Dumas for more than half a century
has imposed on non-psychological fiction. How
admirably he filled it himself. Those splendid
fellows of his, whose cavalier way fairly takes us
off our feet, are not dead puppets made to wield
toy swords at the pulling of a string. There is
something exuberant and infectious even in the
restraint of Athos. They are all alive, not with
an independent, almost hostile existence like that
of the characters of Balzac, but with a vitality
they owe to their creator and to us, the free
coursing blood of boyish dreams. They are the
things that at one time or another we have set
our hearts on being, the things that Dumas
actually was. Where they ride a jolly spirit goes
with them, and we know that Dumas had only
to settle in a quiet village to turn it into a place
of gay and prosperous festivity. 'Madeleine,' says
D'Artagnan at the end of <i>Vingt Ans Apr&egrave;s</i>,
'give me the room on the first floor. I must
keep up my dignity now that I am captain of the
musketeers. But always keep my room on the
fifth floor; one never knows what may happen.'
Is not that just the attitude of Dumas, who
remarked upon his deathbed, 'I took twenty
francs with me to Paris. Well, I have kept them.
There they are,' and pointed to his last louis on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
mantelpiece. In the flamboyant youthfulness of
Dumas, who died a boy at sixty-seven, and called
Mazarin 'still young, for he was only fifty-six,' is
perhaps that characteristic that made Romanticism
in France so complete and satisfactory a
Renaissance. When such men as he were writing
books the world had won its youth again.</p>

<h2>BALZAC</h2>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<h3>BALZAC</h3>

<div class="sidenote">His vitality.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Balzac</span> used to tell a story of his father, who,
when asked to carve a partridge, not knowing
how to set about it, rolled up his sleeves, gripped
his knife and fork, and cut it in four with such
energy as to cleave the plate at the same time
and embed the knife in the table. That was the
manner of setting about things natural to Balzac
himself. He was a 'joyous wild boar' of a man,
with the build and strength of a navvy. He
was never ill. Gautier tells us that the habitual
expression of that powerful face was a kind of
Rabelaisian glee. Now a man who could write
the <i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i> and look aside from it with
a Rabelaisian glee was perhaps the only kind of
man who could have attempted such a task without
being turned, willy nilly, into a pedant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conception
of the
<i>Com&eacute;die
Humaine</i>.</div>

<p>There was a logic, a completeness, in the
groundwork of the scheme, that would have
sterilised the imagination of a man with less
exuberant vitality. Compare for a moment the
<i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i> with the novels of Sir Walter
Scott. Scott meant to Balzac what Maria
Edgeworth had meant to himself. He had seen
in her an attempt to paint Irish country and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
character, and had decided to do the same for
Scotland. Balzac after those ten years of bad
medi&aelig;val stories, those ten years of labour for the
Rachel of his own soul, saw in him an attempt to
paint Scottish country and character, and decided
to do the same for France. But, whereas Scott
had been brought up on the <i>Reliques of English
Poetry</i>, and in the country of purple heather,
grey rock, and leaping stream, Balzac was nourished
on philosophy and science, and spent his youth in
a Paris lodging. Scott saw men rather than
kinds of man. Bailie Nicol Jarvie is more
Nicol Jarvie than Bailie. Balzac comes at life in
a much more scientific spirit. 'Does not Society
make of man,' he asks, as Chaucer has unconsciously
asked before him, 'as many different men
as there are varieties in zoology? The differences
between a soldier, a labourer, an administrator, an
idler, a savant, a statesman, a merchant, a sailor,
a poet, a pauper, a priest, are, though more difficult
to seize, as considerable as those that distinguish
the wolf, the lion, the ass, the crow, the
shark, the sea-calf, the goat, etc.' Balzac made
up his mind to collect specimens of the social
species, not pressed and dried, like the old
'Characters' of the seventeenth century, but
exhibited alive and in their natural surroundings.
He was to make a world with the colour of contemporary
France, an 'august lie, true in its
details,' a world complete in itself, a world in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>which all the characters were to show the impress
of that state of life to which it should please
Balzac to call them. That was the idea that
turned the Waverley Novels into the <i>Com&eacute;die
Humaine</i>, that the idea whose exposition by a less
full-blooded professor would have been so readily
precise, so readily dull in its precision.</p>

<div class="caption">HONOR&Eacute; DE BALZAC</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Physical
energy and
the task of
writing.</div>

<p>Now there are few harder tasks for a man of
overflowing physical energy than this, of covering
innumerable sheets of paper with wriggling unnatural
lines traced with the end of a pen. It is
likely to become a torment; the feet cross and
uncross, the fingers itch, the inkpot flies across
the room, and the energy defeats itself. There is
the legend of Scott's hand, covering sheet after
sheet so swiftly and with such regularity that it
was painful to watch it; but Scott's was not the
bomb-like brute energy of Balzac. Balzac, to
give life to his scientific ideas, needed a more fiery
vitality than Scott's, who began and ended with
merely human notions. The actual writing of
his books was proportionately more difficult for
him. There was no mere eccentricity in his habit
of getting the sketches for his books set up in
type, and enlarging them from proofs in the
middle of large sheets of paper, covering the vast
margins with the additions that were to make the
books themselves. It was a wise attempt to give
himself the same physical outlet as that enjoyed
by the painter or sculptor, to give himself something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to pull about, something actual, something
that could be attacked, anything rather than the
terrible silkworm spinning of a single endless
fibre. His energy would have been wasted in a
hundred ways unless, so far as was possible, he
had fitted his work to himself and himself to
his work. Giant of concentration as he was, he
added cubits to his stature by taking thought.
He made his writing hours different from every
one else's, wore a white frock something like a
monk's habit, and found in the drinking of
enormous quantities of coffee a stimulant as much
theatrical as medicinal. These things meant much
to him, and his use of them was an action similar
to that of Poe's schoolboy, who, when guessing
odd or even the marbles in his playmate's hand,
would imitate the expression of his adversary's
face and see what thoughts arose in his mind.
The paraphernalia of work were likely to induce
the proper spirit. When all his fellow Parisians
were in bed, Balzac, gathering the voluminous
white folds about his sturdy person, and glancing
at the coffee stewing on the fire, sat down to his
writing-table with the conviction of an alderman
sitting down to a city dinner. There could never
be a doubt in his mind as to the purpose for
which he was there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Balzac's
prose.</div>

<p>This navvy-work of production had its influence
on the character of his writing. But it was
never in Balzac's nature to have understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Gautier's craftsman's delight in the polishing and
chasing of diminutive things. Balzac, the working
machine, was simply enormous energy so
coaxed and trained as to produce an enormous
output. The raw material of his rich humanity
passed through violent processes. It had but
small chance of any very delicate finish. Balzac
thought in books and in cycles of books, never in
pages, paragraphs, or sentences. Although he
was much preoccupied with 'style,' envying the
men whose writing would be charming to the ear
even if it meant nothing to the mind, the best
of his own prose is unbeautiful, rugged, fiercely
energetic, peculiarly his own, and therefore not to
be grumbled at. He would have liked to write
finely, just as he would have liked <i>la vie splendide</i>.
But his mind, delivering pickaxe blows, or furiously
wrestling with great masses of material,
could not clothe itself in stately periods. Always,
out of any splendour that he made for it,
shows a brown, brawny arm, and the splendour
becomes an impertinence. He had ideas on art,
as he had ideas on science, but his was too large
a humanity to allow itself to be subordinate to
either. He was too full-blooded a man to be
withered by a theory. He was too eager to say
what he had in his mouth to be patient in the
modulation of his voice. He was almost too
much of a man to be an artist. To think of that
man fashioning small, perfect poems, who avowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
that he wrote his <i>Contes Dr&ocirc;latiques</i> because he
happened to notice the fall in the French birth
rate, is to think of a Colossus tinkering at the
mechanism of a watch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
proximity
to life.</div>

<p>Then, too, he had been too close to life to think
of art for art's sake. During the years that
followed his setting up author in a garret, he had
watched the existence of those who are so near
starvation that they seem to make a living by
sweeping the doorstep of Death. And, at the
same time that, walking out in the evenings, and
following a workman and his wife on their way
home, he had been able to feel their rags upon
his back, and to walk with their broken shoes
upon his feet, he had also had his glimpses of <i>la
vie splendide</i>, the more vivid, no doubt, for their
contrast with the sober realities he knew. To
this man, however great a writer he might become,
life would always mean more than books. It
always did. He could cut short other people's
lamentations by saying, 'Well, but let us talk of
real things; let us talk of Eug&eacute;nie Grandet,' but
Eug&eacute;nie Grandet, the miser's daughter, interested
him much more than the mere novel of that name.
His people never existed for the sake of his books,
but always his books for the sake of his people.
He makes a story one-legged or humpbacked
without scruple, so long as by doing so he can
make his reader see a man and his circumstances
exactly as they appeared to himself. He was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
like a pure artist, an instrument on which life
played, producing beautiful things. His concern
with life was always positive. His world was not
a world of dream and patterned imagery, but,
according to his mood, was an elaborate piece of
mechanism and he an impassioned mechanician,
or a zoological garden and he an impassioned
zoologist. It is almost matter for wonder that
such a man should choose to express himself in
narrative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His conception
of the
novel.</div>

<p>And yet the novel, as he conceived it, gave him
the best of opportunities for putting his results
before the world. If we allow ourselves to set all
our attention on politics and finance and social
theory, we lose in life all but the smell of blue-books,
and the grey colour of Stock Exchange
returns. If Balzac had written science, and not
stories, we should have only had the ideas of his
novels without that passionate presentment of concrete
things that gives those ideas their vitality.
Indeed, the novels are far greater than the ideas,
just as the poetic, seeing man in Balzac was
greater than the scientist. Weariless in distinguishing
man from man, type from type, specimen
from specimen, by the slightest indication
of the clay, he was able in novels, as he could
never have done in works of science, to give the
colour of each man's life expressed in his actions,
in his talk, in his choice of clothes, in the furniture
of his room. The action of all novels, like that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
all plays, is performed in the brain of the reader or
spectator. The novelist's and dramatist's characters
are like pieces on a chessboard, symbols of
possibilities not obviously expressed. In older
fiction these possibilities were left so vague that
the reader could adopt any part he chose, without
in the least interfering with the story, independent
as that was of personal character. Never before
Balzac made them had the chessmen assumed so
much of human detail. In his books they are no
longer pegs of wood, depending for their meanings
on the reader's generosity, for their adventures on
the ingenuity of the author. They make their
moves in their own rights. The hero of a Balzac
novel is not the reader, in borrowed clothes, undergoing
a series of quite arbitrary experiences. He
cannot be made to do what the author requires,
but fills his own suits, and has a private life.
Balzac knows and makes his reader feel that his
characters have not leapt ready-made into the
world to eat and drink through a couple of hundred
pages and vanish whence they came. They
have left their mark on things, and things have
left their mark on them. They have lived in
pages where he has not seen them, and Balzac
never drags them to take a part in existences to
which they do not belong. I can remember no
case where Balzac uses a stock scene, a room, or
a garden, or a valley that would do for anything.
There was only one room, one valley, one garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
where the characters could have said those words,
lost that money, or kissed those kisses, and Balzac's
stupendous energy is equal not only to pouring
life into his people, but also to forcing the particular
scene upon his canvas with such vivid
strokes that every cobble seems to have a heart,
and every flower in a pot to sway its blossoms with
the sun. Even in the short stories, where he often
follows gods that are not his own, writing of madness
like a Hoffmann, and of intrigue like a
Boccaccio, his peculiar genius is apparent in the
environments. How carefully, in <i>La Messe de
l'Ath&eacute;e</i>, he works out the conditions of life that
made the story possible for its actors. And, in
the longer novels, there is scarcely a sentence unweighted
with evidence that is of real import to
him who would truly understand the characters
and happenings of the book. How much does
not the story of <i>Eug&eacute;nie Grandet</i> owe to that
description of the little money-getting, vine-growing
town of Saumur, with its cobbled streets,
its old houses, its greedy faces watching the
weather from the house doors, the only proper
setting for the narrow power of Goodman Grandet,
and the leaden monotony of his daughter's life?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Balzac's
world and
that of
Realism.</div>

<p>Balzac's fierce determination that his lies should
be true in their details has often been remarked
in claiming him as the first of the French realists.
And, indeed, others of his characteristics, his interest
in life as it is, the scientific bias that found its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
parody in Zola, his fearlessness in choice of subject,
his entire freedom from classical ideals, are certainly
attributes of realism. Realism is ready, like
Balzac, to deal with stock exchanges and bakeries
and all the side shops of civilisation; realism finds
Greek Greek and not an Elixir of Life; realism
tries to see life as it is. But realism (an impossible
ideal) needs for its approximate attainment a man
of ordinary energy; and this Balzac was not.
Balzac used Thor's hammer, not one from the
carpenter's shop. He lived like ten men and so do
his characters. A crossing-sweeper in a story by
Balzac would wear out his broom in half an hour,
but the broom of a crossing-sweeper of de Maupassant
or Flaubert would be certain of an average
life. Balzac's world is not the world of realism,
because it goes too fast, like a clock without a
pendulum, running at full speed. His world is
more alive than ours, and so are his men. They
are demons, men carried to the <i>n</i>th power. Fire
runs in their veins instead of blood, and we watch
them with something like terror, as if we were
peeping into hell. They are superhuman like
Balzac himself, and have become a kind of lesser
divinities. None but he would have dared 'to
frame their fearful symmetry.' None but they
could so well have illustrated existence as Balzac
saw it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A new
motive in
fiction.</div>

<p>And life, as this Rabelaisian Frenchman saw it,
in the chaotic years of the nineteenth century, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
terrible thing except to the blind and the numbed,
and to those who, like himself, possessed 'unconquerable
souls.' He found two primary motives
in existence. Passion and the production of
children was one. He said that this was the only
one. But his life and his work made it clear that
there was another, and that this other was money.
Money, the need of it, the spending of it, fantastic
but always acute plans for getting hold of it, like
that suggested in <i>Facino Cane</i>, filled his own life,
and were not banished even from his love-letters.
His own obsession by debts and business forced on
him as a novelist a new way of looking at life, and,
through him, gave another outlook to story-telling.
In the older novels, Fielding's for example, rich
were rich, and poor were poor, and only to be
changed from one to the other by some calamity
or fairy godmother of a coincidence. People were
static; unless they turned out to be Somebody's
illegitimate son or rightful heir, their clothes were
not of a finer cut as they grew older, and if they
ate off wooden platters in the first chapter, they
supped no more daintily in the last. In romantic
tales and fairy stories, a hero might cut his way
to fortune through dragons or piratical Turks; in
the rogue novels he might swindle a dinner, and
after long switchbacking between twopence and
nothing, happen by accident upon a competence;
he never, before Balzac took him in hand, went
grimly at life, closing his heart, concentrating his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
energies, compelling even love to help him in his
steady climb from poverty to opulence. He left
that to the villain, and the story-teller took care
that the villain eventually got his deserts. The
older novelists were vastly interested in the progress
of a love-affair; Balzac looks kindly at that,
but his real interest is in the progress of a financial
superman. The wealth and poverty of Balzac's
characters is the quality that makes or breaks
them. The mainspring of their actions is the
desire of getting on in life. What is the tragedy
of Eug&eacute;nie Grandet, but money? What is the
tragedy of P&egrave;re Goriot, but money? Eliminate
wealth and poverty from either of them and they
cease to exist. If old Goriot had been rich and
indulgent to his daughters he would have been an
estimable father; but he is poor; his daughters
must be luxurious, and so he is P&egrave;re Goriot. The
story is that of Lear and his kingdom, translated
into hundred franc notes and lacking the Cordelia.
Love, Wisdom, Gentleness are inconsequent
dreamers in a house of Mammon. They talk in
window corners and behind curtains, ashamed of
their disinterestedness. They are like the old gods
banished from the temples, whispering in secret
places in the woods, and going abroad quietly in
the twilight, while in the glare of noon the clanking
brazen giant strides heavily across the world.</p>

<h3>GAUTIER AND THE EAST</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The East as
a means of
expression.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> East is an invention of the nineteenth century.
We have only to look at the works of
Voltaire or of Goldsmith to see that the Orient
did not exist before the time of the Romantic
movement. To early writers it meant nothing but
polygamy, moguls, elephants, and 'bonzes,' and
the eighteenth-century translation of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i> did little more than supply an entertaining
form to an ironical philosopher. Even when it
became the fashion to make imaginary Orientals
expose the follies of the West, the East had not
yet become alive for us. We find scarcely a hint
in the hundred and twenty letters of <i>The Citizen
of the World</i> that it meant more than a dialectical
expression for topsy-turvydom, a place to which
you could refer as to Lilliput or to Brobdingnag,
useful like the <i>x</i> of algebra in illustrating the
properties of other things. The first glimmerings
of discovery are in Beckford's <i>Vathek</i>, an extravagant
book, belittled by a schoolboyish humour&mdash;as
when the Caliph plays football with the rotund
figure of the Indian Magician&mdash;but written by a
man to whom the East did really mean some sort
of gorgeous dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>For the East is not an expression of philosophy,
or of geography, but of temperament; it is a
dream that has led many to leave their people for
its people, their homes for desert tents, in the
effort to turn its conventions into realities of life.
Men have fallen in love with it, as they have fallen
in love with statues or with the beautiful women
of pictures. It means more than itself, like a man
whom time has lifted into Godhead. It has been
given the compelling power of a religion. I believe
it was an invention made possible by the
discovery of local colour. With the emphasis of
local colour came an emphasised difference in
places. Minds only mildly preferring one place
to another when both were vague, most vigorously
preferred one or other place when both were
realised in vivid detail, and could be readily compared.
Fastidious minds seeking the stage-properties
of expression could choose them in the
booths of all the world. Men who did not care
for the settings of their own lives were able to fill
out their dim Arcadias with detail, and vein their
phantom goddesses with blood.</p>

<p>The East, when Gautier was growing up in the
rich tastes of the Romantic movement, was ready
to supply the most delicious conventions. Goethe
had shown its possibilities. It was there like a
many-coloured curtain behind which he could
build a world less entangled, less unmanageable
than his own. Its newness must not be forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in considering his use of it, and in thinking of his
use of Antiquity we must remember that it was
as novel as the East.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Antique.</div>

<p>Now the Antique was one of the cudgels with
which the Classicists tried to beat the heads of the
Romanticists in the battles of that time. It did
not mean to Gautier what it meant to them. Its
metamorphosis was simultaneous with the birth
of the East, and had almost the same cause. Insisting
on local colour in places, the Romanticists
insisted also on local colour in humanity. Cromwell
was to be allowed to say that he had the
parliament in his bag and the king in his pocket.
C&aelig;sar was to be allowed to talk like a man and
even to be one. So that for Gautier Antiquity
meant not a cold inhumanity that had been
beautiful, but a warm, full-blooded life that worshipped
simple, energetic gods, and found expression
in a thousand ways other than the speech of
blank verse and heroic actions that had been so
often represented in pictures of an annoying
timidity of colouring. The East and the Antique
together had been touched as if by magic, and
turned from the abstract into the concrete, from
the heroic into the human, and so into the very
material for personal expression.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The East
and Arcadia.</div>

<p>Gautier's attitude towards the East is not unlike
that of the Elizabethans towards Arcadia. Sir
Philip Sidney, courtier, soldier, and busy statesman,
wrote in terms of shepherds, shepherdesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and shipwrecked princes, and worked in an ideal
atmosphere where no cares were greater than love,
or a thorn in a lamb's foot. He, with</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">seemed to belong to that Golden Age which has
never been now, but always long ago. And
Gautier, busy writer of articles and travel-books,
massive and vividly alive, could not persuade himself
to be Parisian and contemporary. Nor would
it be extravagant to compare him with the pastoral
writers of to-day, Celtic and Gaelic, who like
him lift their emotions into a simpler, more
congenial atmosphere, and like him insist continually
on the local colour of their dreams. These
writers, sitting in London or in Edinburgh, hear,
without moving from their comfortable chairs, the
cry of the curlew on the moor, and are transported
to a quiet bay, half enclosed by cliffs, 'in two white
curves, like the wings of the solander when she
hollows them as she breasts the north wind,' and
under the spells of an intenser imagined life find
their own emotions more vivid and more easily
expressed. Gautier, sitting in Paris, sees the
swallows fluttering about the roofs and flying south
in autumn.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="noin">That cry for wings is the keynote of his most
passionately beautiful work. When he is at his
best; when he is not projecting young men with
a mathematical freedom of morals into a Western
society; in those moments when he is most himself,
we hear clipped feathers beat against the bars.
He sought to escape from Paris to the Enchanted
Islands, and from the nineteenth century to the
Golden Age. The Enchanted Islands he had
identified with the East, and the Golden Age
was the time of the Pharaohs or of the making of
the Venus. As the Christian fingers his crucifix
and is able to kneel upon the footsteps of the
throne, so Gautier found talismans to help his
dreams to their desires. A mummy's foot, a
marble hand took him to the times he loved, or
half revealed the perfections that reality refused.
A curiosity shop was a postern-gate to heaven,
and a merchant of antiquities held St. Peter's
keys.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The story-telling
of
dreams.</div>

<p>His art is that of making his dreams come true.
He is not an observer of life, like Richardson,
Fielding, or De Maupassant. He does not copy
the surface of contemporary existence; but cuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
away all but passion, and clothes that in symbols
whose strangeness disentangled it and helped him
to make it real. Beautiful women step down to
him from their tapestries, and, living on drops of
his blood, come back to him out of their graves.
The Princess Hermonthis claims her little foot
that he has bought as a paper-weight, and takes
him to the tomb of the Pharaohs and the pre-adamite
kings sitting with their thousand peoples
waiting for the final day. The Pompeian harlot
is brought alive by the love of a youth for the
imprint her perfect breasts have left in molten
lava. He is ill at ease in his most famous <i>Roman
de la Momie</i> until he has finished with the
Englishman and the doctor, and is translating
the scroll of papyrus buried three thousand years
ago with Tahoser in the sarcophagus.</p>

<div class="caption">TH&Eacute;OPHILE GAUTIER</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Gautier
the man.</div>

<p>But it is too easy to construct a man out of his
work. It is more interesting to compare the man
of this world with the man he would have liked
to be, and the man he chose to express. Gautier
was not pure dreamer. Though the world of his
art was as far from the world of Paris, as the world
of Mr. Yeats from the world of London or
Dublin, he was not a seer, or a poet between
whom and reality hung a veil of dreams. He
was a solid man, one of whose proudest memories
was a blow that registered five hundred and
thirty-two pounds on an automatic instrument,
the result of daily washing down five pounds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>gory mutton with three bottles of red Bordeaux.
He was a Porthos, and the Gautier of his stories,
that gorgeous barbaric figure, was his boast,
cherished as Porthos cherished his dignity. The
traits he loved in himself were those that gave
colour to his fiction. His olive skin, his strength,
his vitality, his scorn of the religion of sacrifice&mdash;these
were the details he caressed. He was never
tired of insisting on everything that helped in this
Oriental and Antique projection of himself. His
hero in <i>Mademoiselle de Maupin</i> exclaims: 'I am
a man of the Homeric times; the world where I
live does not belong to me, and I do not understand
the society about me. Christ has not yet
come for me; I am as pagan as Alcibiades and
Phidias.... I find the earth as beautiful as
heaven, and I think that perfection of form is
virtue. I love a statue better than a phantom,
and full noon better than twilight. Three things
please me: gold, marble and purple, splendour,
solidity, colour.' When a reviewer described him
as a being, 'fat, jovial, and sanguinary,' he quotes
the description with gratitude, and explains gleefully
that it refers to his taste for bull-fights. He
begins a book: 'People have often caricatured us,
dressed like a Turk, cross-legged on cushions....
The caricature is only an exaggeration of the
truth.' That was how he liked to think of
himself, and how he would like to be imagined.
It is interesting to know that he was a kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
bear of a man, who was always called by his
Christian name, and delighted in astonishing his
friends with outbursts of genius served up in a
joyous obscenity.</p>

<p>He was not a man of wealth as his work
suggests; but an extremely industrious journalist.
Like Balzac, he was proud of his prodigious
activity. He confesses that he wrote about three
hundred volumes: but that is the estimate of
Porthos; his biographer puts the number at sixty.
From his twenty-fifth year he was an artist on a
treadmill, and only at every hundredth, or two
hundredth, or three hundredth turn of the wheel
could he escape for a little and try to satisfy
himself. That is why his poems and shorter
stories are the most perfect specimens of his
later work. He needed things that could be
roughed out in a sitting and carried about without
risk until the time when he could work on
them again. He was able to hurry out of sight
his dozen sheets for the <i>Presse</i> or the <i>Figaro</i>, sit
down on his cushions, let his fingers run through
the long hair of a Persian cat, and turn over again
and again one of the minute Enamels or Cameos
of his poetry. In so small a space he could afford
to be fastidious. He could take up the little thing
a week later, and a month after that, and file and
polish it to his content. It was the same with
the stories. The story-telling Gautier was a
Gautier on holiday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>

He was a complete man, and could, in active
life, have twisted the present if he had chosen.
But he did not choose. As for politics, 'what
does it matter whether one is ruled by a sabre, a
sprinkler of holy-water, or an umbrella?' He has
been censured for this, but the censure means no
more than to say he was a perfect artist unfortunately
not interested in local government.
One does not ask a shoemaker if his soles and
uppers are Socialist or only gentle Liberal. As
for his own life, he worked hard, brought up his
children, but found his emotions too intricate to
please him. He had to separate them, and
translate them into terms of another time and
place. Modernity rattled past him, like the
chariots of the king past the potter, who would
not look up from his wheel lest an ugly curve
should throw awry the vessel he was shaping.
Gautier did his duty by this world and left it,
discovering for others what Baudelaire called 'the
consolation of the arts,' and finding peace himself
in the less encumbered simplicity of his Ancient
and Oriental Arcadia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The flowers
of the white
narcissus.</div>

<p>His work was the construction of a paradise for
himself in which other people are allowed to walk.
His stories are a substitute for opium and
haschisch, and take us into a world like that of
old romance and myth, where we meet our own
souls walking in strange clothes. 'Art,' says
Santayana, 'so long as it needs to be a dream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
will never cease to be a disappointment.' We
leave a volume of Gautier as we leave the
<i>Mabinogion</i>, or the <i>Morte Darthur</i>, or the
<i>Volsunga Saga</i>, or a book of fairy-tales. We
have to readjust ourselves before meeting the
difficulties of life. But opposite Santayana's
sentence we may set one from Mahomet. 'If
any man have two loaves, let him sell one, and
buy flowers of the white narcissus; for the one is
food for the body and the other is food for the
soul.' And perhaps this art, where the world is
simplified into the conventions of a tapestry, by
its intense appeal to primitive emotions, may
help us like a touchstone to distinguish between
the things to which more than lip-service is
slavery, and the things to which less than life-service
is death.</p>

<h2>POE AND THE NEW TECHNIQUE</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<h3>POE AND THE NEW TECHNIQUE</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Self-conscious
method.</div>

<p class="noin">'<span class="smcap">It</span> is the curse,' says Poe, 'of a certain order of
mind that it can never rest satisfied with the consciousness
of its ability to do a thing. Not even
is it content with doing it. It must both know and
show how it was done.' It is all very well to call
it a curse; it is the curse that gave us Leonardo's
notebooks, Reynolds' Discourses, and Stevenson's
few essays on the art of writing; the curse that
is among the reasons of Leonardo's excellence,
Reynolds' excellence, Stevenson's excellence, and
the excellence of Poe himself. It is the curse that
is the secret of all real knowledge of technique.
The man who is as interested in the way of doing
a thing as in the thing when done, is the man who
is likely to put a new tool in the hands of his
fellow-craftsmen.</p>

<p>Poe's methods were such a delight to him that
his works have an uncanny atmosphere about them,
as if he had not written them but had been present,
passionately observant and critical, while they
were being written by somebody else. More than
once he used his pen to make a new thing out of
a discussion of an old one, and on these occasions
he dissects his own motives in so impersonal a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
manner that it is difficult for the reader to remember
that the author examining is in any way
connected with the author undergoing examination.
<i>The Raven</i>, for example, a profound piece of
technique, is scarcely as profound, and certainly
not as surprising, as <i>The Philosophy of Composition</i>,
in which its construction is minutely analysed, and
Poe callously explains, as a matter of scientific
rather than personal interest, that the whole poem
was built on the refrain 'Nevermore,' and that
this particular refrain was chosen on account of
the sonority and ease of <i>o</i> and <i>r</i> sounded together.
It was inevitable that such a man busying himself
with story-telling should bring something new into
the art.</p>

<div class="caption">WILLIAM GODWIN</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">William
Godwin and
<i>Caleb
Williams</i>.</div>

<p>Another story-teller, who, like Poe, was a
philosopher and deeply interested in technique,
had existed before, and from him Poe had that
strengthening of his ideas that is given by outside
confirmation. He refers often to William Godwin,
the author of <i>An Enquiry concerning Political
Justice</i> and of several novels, among them one
now most undeservedly half forgotten, called <i>Caleb
Williams</i>. It is seldom possible to point to any
one book as the sign-post of a literary cross-roads,
but there can be no doubt that in <i>Caleb Williams</i>
we see the beginnings of self-conscious construction
in story-telling. Of that book Hazlitt wrote:
'No one ever began <i>Caleb Williams</i> that did not
read it through: no one that ever read it could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>possibly forget it, or speak of it after any length
of time but with an impression as if the events
and feelings had been personal to himself.' And
the author not only had done this, but had known
how it was done. It is usual to say that Poe
himself was the first to choose an effect and then
plan a story to produce it. But <i>Caleb Williams</i>
was published in 1794, and in a preface to one of
the later editions Godwin gave his methods away.
On him also lay that fruitful curse. He wrote:
'I formed a conception of a book of fictitious
adventure that should in some way be distinguished
by a very powerful interest. Pursuing
this idea, I invented first the third volume of my
tale, then the second, and last of all the first.'</p>

<p>Godwin perhaps did not realise how revolutionary
was his attitude, and even Hazlitt, delighted
as he was by their results, does not seem to have
noticed the novelty of his methods. But Poe,
finding Godwin's ideas of the very temper of his
own, developed them logically as far as they would
go, and in two paragraphs that I am going to
quote, expressed in a final manner the principles
of self-conscious construction.</p>
<div class="sidenote">The
architecture
of narrative.</div>
<p>The first is taken from an essay on Hawthorne:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'A skilful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise,
he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his
incidents; but, having conceived, with deliberate care, a
certain unique or single effect to be worked out, he then
invents such incidents&mdash;he then contrives such events as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
may best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect.
If his very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing of
the effect, then he has failed in his first step. In the whole
composition there should be no word written, of which the
tendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one pre-established
design. And by such means, with such care and skill, a
picture is at length painted which leaves in the mind of
him who contemplates it with a kindred art a sense of the
fullest satisfaction. The idea of the tale has been presented
unblemished, because undisturbed.' ...</p></blockquote>

<p>The second is more personal, and from <i>The
Philosophy of Composition</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I prefer commencing with the consideration of an <i>effect</i>....
Keeping originality always in view, I say to myself, in
the first place, "Of the innumerable effects or impressions
of which the heart, the intellect, or (more generally) the
soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present occasion,
select?" Having chosen a novel first, and secondly a vivid
effect, I consider whether it can be best wrought out by
incident or tone&mdash;whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar
tone, or the converse, or by peculiarity both of incident and
tone&mdash;afterwards looking about me (or rather within) for
such combination of event and tone as shall best aid me in
the construction of the effect.'</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Masque of
the Red
Death.</i></div>

<p>Here, of course, he is exaggerating actual fact
to make his meaning more clear; but I am sure
that even the exaggeration is deliberate. If he
did not literally work in that way he certainly
worked in that spirit. A writer of Poe's fertility
of imagination would be at least biassed in choosing
his effect by consideration of material already in
his head. But, the effect once chosen, he left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
nothing to chance. He would never, like the older
story-tellers, allow himself to be carried away by
a wave of his own emotion. He stands beside de
Maupassant and the conscious artists of the latter
half of the nineteenth century. His emotional
material is never emptied carelessly in front of the
reader. Chosen scraps of it are laid before him,
one by one, in a chosen order, producing a more
powerful effect than the unrestrained discharge of
the whole. The first sentences of one of his stories
prepare its readers for the atmosphere demanded
by its conclusion. In <i>The Masque of the Red
Death</i>, for example, revolting horror is the emotion
on which he built. So, from the terrible opening
lines, 'The Red Death had long devastated the
country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal
and so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and seal&mdash;the
redness and the horror of blood. There were
sharp pains and sudden dizziness, and then profuse
bleeding at the pores, with dissolution ...' to the
end, 'And now was acknowledged the presence
of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in
the night. And one by one dropped the revellers
in the blood-bedewed hall of their revel, and died,
each in the despairing posture of his fall. And
the life of the ebony clock went out with that of
the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods
expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red
Death held illimitable dominion over all,' we are
led on through consciously created disquietude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
terror. How menacing is the sentence that immediately
follows the prelude: 'But the Prince Prospero
was happy and dauntless and sagacious.' We feel
at once that the shadow of death is at his elbow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
detective
stories.</div>

<p>Perhaps Poe's technique is more easily examined
in those of his tales in which the same
faculties that planned the construction supplied
also the motive. The three great detective
stories, <i>The Purloined Letter</i>, <i>The Murders in
the Rue Morgue</i>, and <i>The Mystery of Marie
Roget</i>, are made of reasoning and built on
curiosity, the very mainspring of analysis. It is
a profitable delight to take any one of these
stories, and, working backwards from the end to
the beginning, to follow the mind of the architect.
Each of the tales states a difficulty and secretes
an explanation that is gradually to be reached by
the reader, who identifies the processes of his
own mind with those of the analytical Dupin.
Starting always with the solution, we can watch
Poe refusing the slightest irrelevance, and at
the same time artfully piling up detail upon detail
in exactly that order best calculated to keep
the secret, to heighten the curiosity, to disturb
the peace of the reader's mind, and to hold him
in conjectural suspense until the end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poe's mind.</div>

<p>But it is easy, in considering the technique of
Poe's stories, his smiling refusal of 'inspiration,'
his confident mastery over his material, to let the
brilliance of his analytical powers hide from us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
his intimacy with the beautiful, the richness and
vividness of his imagination, and, particularly, the
passionate character of his mind. Like Leonardo
da Vinci, he was a man whose works were the
result of the energetic fusing of an emotional
personality into moulds designed by reason. Not
all Leonardo's theories and calculations would
have sufficed to make a <i>Mona Lisa</i>. And if
Poe had been merely a skilled technician, like
so many of his imitators, we should have had
from him only unbeautiful toys no less valueless
than theirs. All Poe's work depends, like all
Leonardo's, on his power of retaining the poetry,
the energy of his material, after submitting it to
his constructive science, and then, when the
moulds have been made, of pouring it into them
red-hot and fluid, as if in the primal vitality of its
conception. In those very detective stories, that
seem built by and of the coldest-blooded reason,
what is it that makes them great but Poe's
absorbing passion for the manner of mind of their
leading character. Dupin is not a mere detective.
He is not an analyst, but analysis. He is the
embodiment of the logical spirit in mankind, just
as Nicolete, in the old French tale, is the embodiment
of the loving spirit in womankind. It is for
this reason that some have accused Dupin and
Nicolete of a lack of individuality. They are not
individual, but universal.</p>

<p>If we would understand the matter as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the manner of his stories, we must think of him
as two men, and remember that the same sensibility
that served the man of anagrams, and
ciphers, and detective puzzles, served also the
worshipper of beauty, and made him tremble like
a lover at the faintest whisper of her name.
Delicately balanced, alike as analyst and &aelig;sthete,
he was moved profoundly by the smallest circumstance.
Just as a glass of wine was sufficient to
overturn his reason, so the least wind of suggestion
stirred his brain in a deep and surprising
manner. Nothing that happened to him touched
him only on the surface. Everything dropped to
the depths of him, and sometimes returned
enriched and recreated. Ideas that others would
have passed over became for him and for his readers
powerful, haunting and inevitable. Ideas of
mesmerism, of hypnotism, and of madness, that
have been for so many lesser artists only the
materials for foolishness, were pregnant for him
with wonderful effects and stories that, once
read, can never be forgotten. In <i>William Wilson</i>
he is using less flippantly than Stevenson the
idea of dual personality. In <i>The Oval Portrait</i>,
where a painter transfers the very soul of his lady
to his canvas, and, as the portrait seems to breathe
alive, turns round to find her dead, he is using the
subtle, half-thought things that an earlier writer
would scarcely have felt, or, if he had, would have
brushed, like cobwebs, secretly aside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His failures.</div>

<p>With a mind so sensitive, a coinage so rare,
and a technique so thorough, it is curious that
he should so frequently have failed. And yet,
when we examine his failures they are not difficult
to explain. They are due in every case, saving
only his attempts to be funny, which are like
hangman's jokes, to sudden rents in the veils of
his illusions, made by single impossible phrases
whose impossibility he seems to have been
unable to recognise. I could give a hundred
examples, but perhaps none better than the
excruciating line in an otherwise beautiful poem,
where he tells us that</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'The sweet Lenore hath "gone before," with Hope, that flew beside.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">Lapses like that destroy like lightning flashes the
mysterious atmosphere he has been at pains to
create. They are the penalty he had to pay
for being a citizen in a youthful democracy.
Americans are never safe from the pitfalls of a
language that is older than their nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
isolation.</div>

<p>In the America of that time, Poe was like the
little boy in the grocer's shop, who, while the
shopmen are busy with paper and string, dreams
of green meadows and scribbles verses on the
sugar bags. Even in Europe he would have been
one of those men 'who live on islands in the sea
of souls.' There are some like Scott and Gautier
who are always called by their Christian names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and can talk unreservedly with a thousand.
There are others more aloof in mind of whom it is
difficult even to think with familiarity. It seems
fitting enough to hear of Scott as Walter or
Wattie, and of Gautier as Th&eacute;o, even in old age;
but who would have dared to call that man
Tommy who heard in tavern song some echo of
the music of the spheres? There are men who
cannot be habitually good companions, and, when
the talk is at its loudest, turn from the crowd,
pull aside the curtain, and look up to see the pale
moon far above the housetops. Such a man was
Poe. He would have been lonely even in the
city of Europe where he could perhaps have found
three men of his own aloofness from the inessential,
his own hatred of the commonplace,
his own intense belief in individualism. He was
extraordinarily lonely in America. His love of
beauty, his elevation of his work above its results
in gold, were next to incomprehensible by that
people in that chaotic state of their development.
Energetic and wholly practical, fiercely busied
with material advancement, they could not understand
his passionate, impractical, intellectual
existence. His biographer, a literary man,
remembered not that he was a great artist, but
that he died through drink, not that he had made
beautiful things but that he had gained little
money by doing so. In the Poe who 'reeled across
Broadway on the day of the publication of <i>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Raven</i>,' in the Poe who died in an hospital, they
forgot the reality, and, in their hurry, found it
easy to make a melodrama out of a gentle and
inoffensive life. Their traditional idea of Poe
allows his extravagances to represent him. It is
as if we were to describe some hills by saying
there was a lightning flash between the peaks.
I prefer to think of the little cottage at Fordham,
where he lived with his wife and her mother, and
their pets, parrots and bobolinks, a peaceful,
small citadel held by those three friends against
the world. Throughout Poe's harassed existence
this note of gentleness and quiet is always sounding
somewhere below the discords of penury and
suffering.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His work.</div>

<p>The result of his isolation, his poverty, his
sensibility, and his intellectual energy was a great
deal of work of no value whatever, some melancholy
and beautiful verse, critical articles of a
kind then new in America, a philosophical poem,
some tales of the same flavour as the most delightful
of Euclid's propositions, and some other
stories that can only be fully enjoyed by those who
come to them with the reverence and careful
taste it is proper to bring to a glass of priceless
wine. It is by them chiefly that he will be
remembered. They are a delicacy, not a staple
of food. They are not stories from which we
can learn life; but they are the key to strange
knowledge of ourselves. They leave us richer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
not in facts but in emotions. We find our way
with their help into novel corners of sensation.
They are like rare coloured goblets or fantastic
metal-work, and we find, often with surprise, that
we have waited for them. That is their vindication,
that the test between the valueless and the
invaluable of the fantastic. There are tales of
twisted extravagance that stir us with no more
emotion than is given by an accidental or
capricious decoration never felt or formed in the
depths of a man. But these stories, like those
patterns, however grotesque, that have once
meant the world to a mind sensible to beauty,
have a more than momentary import. Like old
melody, like elaborate and beautiful dancing, like
artificial light, like the sight of poison or any
other concentrated power, they are among the
significant experiences that are open to humanity.</p>

<h3>HAWTHORNE AND MORAL
ROMANCE</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The essayist
in story-telling.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Hawthorne</span> is one of the earliest story-tellers
whom we remember as much for himself as for his
books. He is loved or hated, as an essayist is
loved or hated, without reference to the subjects
on which he happened to write. He wrote in a
community for whom a writer was still so novel
as to possess some rags of the old splendours of
the sage; an author was something wonderful,
and no mere business man. He had not to expect
any hostility in his reader, but rather a readiness
to admire (of which he seldom took advantage),
and an eagerness to enjoy him for his own sake.
He could assume, as an essayist assumes when he
dances naked before his readers, that they were
not there to scoff. He brought a sweet ingenuous
spirit into modern story-telling that would perhaps
have been impossible had he been writing for a
more sophisticated audience. We love him for
it. He made books, he said, 'for his known and
unknown friends.' As he says it, he brings us all
into the circle. When we think of Fielding,
Bunyan, or Cervantes, we think of <i>Tom Jones</i>,
<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, and <i>Don Quixote</i>; when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
think of <i>Elia</i>, <i>Table Talk</i>, and <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>,
we think of Lamb, Hazlitt, and Hawthorne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hawthorne
and Poe.</div>

<p>This engaging, unsuspicious, essayistical attitude
of his would have been quite impossible to Poe;
but we must remember that Hawthorne and
Poe, although contemporary, knew very different
Americas. Poe's birth was a kind of accident,
and he approached America penniless, so that she
was a hostile place to him, a country of skinflint
editors and large terrible towns, from which to
escape in books, and, as far as possible, in life.
He hated the New America, but he belonged to
her. Hawthorne belonged to the old. His family
connected him with her history; he was never at
her mercy; as we learn from his rambling prefaces,
that would be intolerable in a less lovable writer,
she was endeared to him by a delightful boyhood,
and did not refuse him a peaceful youth of devotion
to his art. She never treated him otherwise
than tenderly, and he did not leave her until as a
representative of her people, nor sought escape
from her in books, except for those of his shadowy
creatures who could move with greater freedom
in a less bread-and-buttery fairyland.</p>

<div class="caption">NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Hawthorne's
life.</div>

<p>His life, as we learn it from those prefaces and
from his biographers, was as gentle as the man
himself. We read of quiet days of work in a
study from whose windows he could watch the
sunlight through the willow boughs; of days on
the river with Thoreau in a canoe which that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>angular reformer had built with his own hands;
of meetings with Emerson walking in the woods,
'with that pure intellectual gleam diffused about
his person like the garment of a shining one'; of
evenings before the red fire in a little room with
white moonlight bringing out the patterns on the
carpet, weaving the tapestries of dream that were
next day to come alive upon the paper. These
people, who were to make the intellectual life
of America, were not American in the peace of
their existence. Hawthorne, in the newest of all
countries, wrote 'in a clear, brown, twilight atmosphere.'
He was a lover of secondhand things,
and so clothed things with his imagination that
all he touched was green with ivy. No contemporary
or even historical romances have about
them such ancient tenderness and legendary dusk
as his. It is extraordinary to think that he was
born within two years of Poe. He thought 'the
world was very weary, and should recline its vast
head on the first convenient pillow and take an
age-long nap.' America, at least, had a thousand
other things to do, but it was not until he had
seen Europe that Hawthorne recognised the fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His
notebooks.</div>

<p>His notebooks reflect at the same time this
quiet life and its excitements, the stirring adventures
of an artist in search of perfection. He
'had settled down by the wayside of life like a
man under an enchantment.' None but the artist
can know how happy such enchantment is. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
notices the flashing soles of a boy's bare feet
running past him in the wood, and 'a whirlwind,
whirling the dried leaves round in a circle, not
very violently.' He writes one day, 'The tops of
the chestnut trees have a whitish appearance, they
being, I suppose, in bloom'; two days later,
unsatisfied, he makes another attempt to fit his
words to his impression:&mdash;'The tops of the chestnut
trees are peculiarly rich, as if a more luscious
sunshine were falling on them than anywhere else,
"Whitish," as above, don't express it.' One of
his biographers, himself no mean artist, suggests
that Hawthorne's must have been a dull existence,
if in it such trifles were worthy of note. But
the frequency of such notes, interspersed by innumerable
sketches for stories, is not a sign of the
poverty of Hawthorne's life but of its opulence.
For Hawthorne, busied always with dim things
not easily expressed, every walk was a treasure
hunt that might supply some phrase, some simile,
that would give blood and sinew to the ghost of
an idea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The material
of his work.</div>

<p>His friends were as far removed from the
ordinary as himself. He was never 'bustled in
the world of workaday.' Even his spell of life as
surveyor in the Customs was such that his
description of it reads not unlike Charles Lamb's
recollections of the old clerks in the South-Sea
House. The Customs House was a place of sleep
and cobwebs, and the people in it, mostly retired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
sea-captains, 'partook of the genius of the place.'
'Pour conna&icirc;tre l'homme,' says Stendhal, 'il suffit
de l'&eacute;tudier soi-m&ecirc;me; pour conna&icirc;tre les hommes,
il faut les pratiquer.' Hawthorne had never kept
company with men; his nature and his circumstances
made him learn man from his own heart.
He was never hampered as a romancer by the
kind of knowledge that would have made him
a novelist. He deals not with manners, for he
had little opportunity of studying them, nor with
passions, for they had not greatly troubled him,
but with conscience. He plays upon the strings
of conscience, and, dusty as the instrument may
be, his playing wakes an echo.</p>

<p>Perhaps if he had been less personal, less
lovable, we could not have tolerated his tampering
with those secret strings whose music is so novel
and so poignant. Certainly we would have found
him intolerable if he had been less serious. If
he had jangled those fibres with a laugh they
would have given no response. If he had waked
them with a careless discord they would have
broken. We can bear it because he is Hawthorne;
we listen to him because he is in earnest.
All, in such matters, depends upon the attitude
of the artist. War, for example, is a terrible
thing in Tolstoy, a joyous thing in Dumas, and an
ordinary thing, neither terrible nor joyous, in
Smollett. We take to ourselves something of an
artist's outlook, and sin is nothing to us unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
we hear of it from a man to whom it is
momentous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Goya's
'Monk and
Witch'.</div>

<p>I remember a little picture by Goya representing
a monk and a witch. The woman, with
white staring eyeballs, wide nostrils, fallen jaw,
shrinks back against the monk in puling terror;
and he, crazed utterly, his eyes fixed on nothingness,
shrieks with gaping mouth some horrid
incantation that drowns the gasping breathing of
the witch. Theirs is no physical fear of fire or
sword or scourge: they have sinned, and seen the
face of God. Before me are a set of reproductions
of Holbein's 'Dance of Death.' Death lies before
the feet of the burgess in the road, plucks unconcernedly
at the robe of the abbot, viciously sticks
a spear through the middle of the knight, and
snuffs the altar candles in the nun's cell, where
her young lover is playing on a guitar. But the
picture of Judgment at the end is no more than
a careless grace after meat. It is there with
propriety but without conviction. Death is a full
stop, not a comma. What is it to me that the
burgess may have cheated, the abbot be a hypocrite,
the knight a roysterer, and the nun a
wanton? Death is close at hand to put a stop to
the doings of them all. I do not know what was
the sin of the monk or the witch, and yet the
mere memory of their spiritual terror moves me
more than the pictures before my eyes. Their
peril is not of this world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The background
of
Hawthorne's
tales.</div>

<p>Hawthorne's finest stories are a Dance of Death,
in which Death is no mere end of a blind alley,
but a dividing of the ways. Those dim people
he found in his own soul are important to us by
their chances of salvation or damnation. Their
feet</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'Are in the world as on a tight-rope slung</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">The background to their actions is not happiness
and misery, questions of this world only, but
righteousness and mortal sin. The fortunes of
Hawthorne's characters are shaping for Eternity.
When Ethan Brand flings himself into the
furnace, what one of Hawthorne's readers ever
thought he died there?</p>

<p>Even this dignity of grave belief, combined
with the charm of the writer, would not excuse
unskilful playing. But Hawthorne is as dexterous
on his chosen instrument as Poe on his, and as
consciously an artist as Stevenson, who indeed, in
<i>Markheim</i>, plays, no more skilfully than he,
Hawthorne's peculiar tune. In the preface to <i>The
House of the Seven Gables</i> there is a paragraph
that, though long, it is not impertinent to quote.
It shows how carefully he had thought out the
possibilities, and how scrupulously he had defined
the limits, of his chosen art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Romance
and Novel.</div>

<blockquote>

<p>'When a writer calls his work a Romance it need hardly
be observed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude, both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>as to its fashion and material, which he would not have felt
himself entitled to assume had he professed to be writing
a Novel. The latter form of composition is presumed to
aim at a very minute fidelity, not merely to the possible,
but to the probable and ordinary course of man's experience.
The former&mdash;while, as a work of art, it must subject
itself to laws, and while it sins unpardonably so far as it
may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart&mdash;has
fairly a right to present that truth under circumstances,
to a great extent, of the writer's own choosing or creation.
If he thinks fit, also, he may so manage his atmospherical
medium as to bring out or mellow the lights, and deepen
and enrich the shadows of the picture. He will be wise,
no doubt, to make a very moderate use of the privileges
here stated, and especially to mingle the Marvellous rather
as a slight, delicate, and evanescent flavour, than as any
portion of the actual substance of the dish offered to the
public. He can hardly be said, however, to commit a
literary crime, even if he disregard this caution.'</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a hint here of the provincial pedant;
'dishes offered to the public' are a little out of
date; but the principles are sound. Hawthorne
could not give clear outlines to the results of his
'burrowings in our common nature' unless he set
them in an atmospherical medium that made such
outlines possible for things so vague and so
mysterious. Romance left him free to do so.
He could make a world to fit them, a patterned
world, coloured to suggest New England, Italy,
or Nowhere. He was never forced to shock us
by introducing them into quite ordinary life. He
never loses command over his 'atmospherical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
medium,' and never weakens the importance of
his characters by letting them escape from the
dominion of morals. And yet his stories are not
'impaled on texts.' Moral feeling makes them
alive, but it is treated like the Marvellous&mdash;'mingled
as a slight, delicate, and evanescent
flavour.' No artist had ever such tricky balances
to keep. No artist keeps his balance more
successfully.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Devices of
craftsmanship.</div>

<p>His artistry is as subtle in the details as in the
design. It is hard to examine his stories unmoved.
But, if we quiet our consciences, and
still the throbbing of our hearts, and force ourselves
to read them paragraph by paragraph with
scientific calm, we find there are few tales from
which we can learn more delicate devices of
craftsmanship in making afraid, and in giving
reality to intangible and mysterious things.
Before such skill the most prosaic reader surrenders
his reason and shudders with the rest.</p>

<p>Notice, for example, in <i>Rappacini's Daughter</i>,
Hawthorne's way of making credible the marvellous.
He states the miracle quite simply, and by
asking 'Was it really so?' lays, without making
his intention obvious, a double emphasis on every
point. On every point he throws a doubt, and
stamps belief into the mind. When Giovanni
wonders if Beatrice is like the flowers in that rich
garden of death, in breath and body poisonous,
'to be touched only with a glove, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to be approached without a mask,' Hawthorne
suggests that he had grown morbid. We know
at once that he had not. A beautiful insect flutters
about her and dies at her feet. 'Now here it
could not be but that Giovanni Guasconti's eyes
deceived him.' We know that they did not. As
Beatrice goes into the house, Giovanni fancies that
the flowers he had given her were already withering
in her grasp. 'It was an idle thought,' says
Hawthorne, 'there could be no possibility of
distinguishing a faded flower from a fresh one at
so great a distance.' We see the dead petals fall
like leaves in autumn as she steps across the
threshold.</p>

<p>And then notice, in <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, his use
of simple actions made significant by their contexts.
When Hester Prynne has thrown aside,
as if for ever, the searing symbol of her outlawry,
her child refuses to recognise her, until she picks
it miserably up, and pains her bosom once again
with the embroidered scarlet character. 'Now
thou art my mother, indeed!' cries the child, 'and
I am thy little Pearl!' And when Hester tells
her that one day the minister will share a fireside
with them, and hold her on his knees, and teach
her many things, and love her dearly&mdash;'And will
he always keep his hand over his heart?' the
child inquires. It is quite natural in her to notice
a peculiar habit, and to cling to a familiar piece of
ornament; but her words and actions assume the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
dignity of portents when we know what they
meant to that poor woman and that conscience-stricken
man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The power
of details.</div>

<p>The imagination needs straws to make its bricks,
and Hawthorne is careful never to set it the impossible
task. He knows how to squeeze all the
emotion in his material into one small fragment
of pictorial suggestion that can be confidently left
to produce its effect in concert with the reader's
mind. Remember how Goodman Brown, at
setting out, looked back and saw 'the head of
Faith still peeping after him with a melancholy
air in spite of her pink ribbons.' A trifle,
apparently, but one that is not to be wasted.
After his talk with the devil, he thought he heard
his wife's voice above him in the air, as an unseen
multitude of saints and sinners were encouraging
her to that awful meeting in the forest. '"Faith!"
he shouted in a voice of agony and desperation,
and the echoes of the forest mocked him, crying
"Faith! Faith!" as if bewildered wretches were
seeking her all through the wilderness. The cry of
grief, rage, and terror was yet piercing the night
when the unhappy wretch held his breath for a
response. There was a scream, drowned immediately
in a louder murmur of voices, fading
into far-off laughter, as the dark cloud swept
away, leaving the dear and silent sky above
Goodman Brown. But something fluttered
lightly down through the air and caught on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
branch of a tree. The young man seized it, and
beheld a pink ribbon.'&mdash;A pink ribbon, a merry
little thing that we can see and touch, is made a
sudden, awful summary of horror and despair.</p>

<p>He makes nature throb with his own mood, and
by imperceptible art weights the simplest words
with the emotion of his tale. How are the very
tones of madness caught as the young man
flourishes the devil's stick and strides along the
forest path. '"Ha! ha! ha!" roared Goodman
Brown when the wind laughed at him. "Let us
hear which will laugh loudest. Think not to
frighten me with your deviltry. Come witch,
come wizard, come Indian powpow, come devil
himself and here comes Goodman Brown. You
may as well fear him as he fear you."' That
paragraph is the work of a master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
character
of his work.</div>

<p>And yet, artist as he was, Hawthorne lived
too near provincialism to show no signs of its
influence in his outlook and his work. He could
not enjoy statues without clothes. He was able
to commit the enormity of typifying a search for
the absolute beautiful by the making of a tiny
toy butterfly that flapped its wings just like a
real one. Nor did he ever reach that conception
of his art, of all art, that sets prettiness in
niches round rather than upon the altar of the
temple. He valued perhaps too highly the simple
flowerlike embroidery that is characteristic of his
work. When, while he was in the Custom House,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
this power of facile prettiness deserted him for a
season, he produced nothing, and feared that all
his power was gone, for it was not in him to
conjure without a wand. He thought afterwards
that he might have written something with the
pedestrian fidelity of the novel; but that was the
one thing he could never do. A man who is
accustomed to see his pages glimmer with opalescent
colour, and to feel the touch of elfin fingers
on his brow, is oddly disconcerted in those
moments when the little people must be brushed
aside like midges, and the glimmering veil be torn
by the elbows of a ruder reality. Such men are
not so common that we can complain of the
<i>d&eacute;fauts de leurs qualit&eacute;s</i>. And indeed, in his more
solemn stories, instinct with the spiritual terror
of Goya's miniature, the grace that never leaves
him adds to the effect. A rapier seems never
more cruel than in a hand elaborately gloved.
What kind of man is that, we ask, who, balancing
souls between Heaven and Hell, can never quite
forget his friendship with the fairies?</p>

<h3>M&Eacute;RIM&Eacute;E AND CONVERSATIONAL
STORY-TELLING</h3>

<div class="sidenote">M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's
attitude
towards
writing.</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a lean athletic air about the tales of
Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e. Their author is like a man
who throws balls at the cocoa-nuts in the fair&mdash;to
bring them down, and not for the pleasure of
throwing. His writing was something quite
outside himself, undertaken for the satisfaction
of feeling himself able to do it. He was in the
habit of setting himself tasks. 'I will blacken
some paper,' he writes, 'in 1829,' and he keeps his
word. He was not an author, in the modern
professional sense, but a man, one of whose
activities was authorship. There is a real difference
between writers of these classes, the amateurs
existing outside their work, the professionals
breathing only through it. Gautier, full-blooded,
brutal, splendid creature, is almost invisible but
in his books. M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, irreproachably dressed,
stands beside his, looking in another direction. I
am reminded of the sporting gentlemen of Hazlitt's
day who now and again would step into the ring
and show that they too had a pretty way with the
gloves. Late in his life, when one of his juvenile
theatrical pieces was to be played for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
time, M&eacute;rim&eacute;e went to the performance, and heard
a hostile noise in the house. 'Is it me they are
hissing?' he asked, 'I am going to hiss with the
rest.' I think of Congreve asking Voltaire to
consider him as a plain gentleman, not as an
author.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/merimee.jpg" width="400" height="621" alt="" />
<div class="caption">PROSPER M&Eacute;RIM&Eacute;E</div>
</div>
<p>Writing was only one of the interests of
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's life; only one of the innumerable tasks
he set himself. He learnt half a dozen languages
without being a mere linguist. He travelled in
half a dozen countries without being a traveller.
He was extremely erudite, but never a bookish
scholar. He fulfilled with enthusiasm his duties
as Inspector of Ancient Monuments without
lapsing into a dusty-handed antiquary. He saw
much of the fashionable life of Paris without being
a man of the world. He was a courtier without
being nothing but a courtier, and could accomplish
a state mission without turning into a diplomatist.
He studied 'la th&eacute;ologie, la tactique, la poliorc&eacute;tique,
l'architecture, l'&eacute;pigraphie, la numismatique,
la magie et la cuisine,' without being solely a theologian,
a tactician, a specialist in sieges, an architect,
a decipherer of inscriptions, a coin collector, a
wizard, or an undiluted cook. No more was he a
writer, as Dumas, Hazlitt, Hawthorne, and Keats
were writers. On no shore did he burn his boats.
His character was as various as his activities. He
was sensualist and sentimentalist, dandy and
Bohemian. Evenings begun in the salon of Mme.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>de Boigne or at the H&ocirc;tel Castellane were, his biographer
tells us, finished behind the scenes at the
Opera. He wrote delightful love-letters, but
whole series of his letters to his friends are unfitted
for print by consistent indecency. He read his
tales to his Empress, and told them in the gipsy
tongue by the camp-fires of Andalusian muleteers.
His experiments in literature were analogous to
his experiments in cooking. Both were expressions
of an intense curiosity about life and the
methods of life, and a thirst for personal practical
efficiency in them all. Never had man more facets
in which to see the world. It is important in this
essay, that considers only one of them, not to
forget that there were others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The imaginary
author
of his tales.</div>

<p>It is indeed not easy to see more than one facet
of a man's personality at once, and difficult not to
assume that this one facet is the whole. The <i>cur&eacute;s</i>
of the old churches in France who saw M&eacute;rim&eacute;e
busied in protecting the ancient buildings from
ruin and restoration would have been amazed by
the witty dandy of the dinners in the Caf&eacute; de la
Rotonde, or by the author of <i>Colomba</i>. Each one
of such a man's expressions suggests a complete
portrait, but only the composite picture tells the
truth. It is difficult not to reason from his work
and build up an imaginary author&mdash;a discreet,
slightly ironical person, who smiles only with the
corners of his mouth, never laughs, never weeps,
modestly disclaims any very personal connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
with his tales, and is careful to seem as little
moved as may be by the terrible or mysterious
things he sets before us. This imaginary polite
person, who represented M&eacute;rim&eacute;e in conversation
as well as in books, is not M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, but, just now,
as I see him quietly smiling in the air before me,
I know who he is. He is the conventional raconteur,
whose manner every Englishman assumes in
the telling of anecdote or ghost story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Printed and
spoken
stories.</div>

<p>Perhaps each nation has its own. Perhaps each
nation adopts an attitude for anecdote peculiar to
its own genius. The French at any rate is very
different from the English. The Frenchman will
gesticulate in his tale, suit the expression of his
face to its emotions, and try, ingratiatingly, to
win our indulgence for his story, that becomes, as
he tells it, part of himself. The Englishman,
more tenacious of his dignity, less willing to
hazard it for an effect, throws all responsibility
upon the thing itself. In England, the distinction
between printed story-telling and story-telling
by word of mouth is more marked than elsewhere.
The object of both is to interest and move us, but,
while the literary artist makes no bones about it,
and takes every advantage possible, giving the
setting of his tale, its colour scheme, its scent, its
atmosphere, the plain Englishman shrinks from all
assumption of craftsmanship, sets out his facts
bare, rough like uncut stones, and repudiates by a
purposely disordered language, perhaps by a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
words of slang, any desire of competition with
the professional.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And we, the audience, allow
ourselves to be moved more readily by an
amateur than by a man who avows his intention
of moving us. The avowed intention provokes a
kind of hostility; it is a declaration of war, an
open announcement of a plan to usurp the throne
of our own mind, and to order the sensations we
like to think we can control. We are more
lenient with the amateur; we wish to save his
face; politeness and good-fellowship are traitors in
our citadel, and we conspire with the enemy to
compass our own yielding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's
adoption of
the conventions
of
anecdote.</div>

<p>M&eacute;rim&eacute;e gives his tales no more background
than an Englishman could put without immodesty
into an after-dinner conversation. He does not
decorate them with words, nor try to suggest
atmosphere by rhythm or any other of the subtler
uses of language. He does not laugh at his jokes,
nor, in moments of pathos, show any mist in his
eyes. The only openly personal touches in his
stories are those sentences of irony as poignant as
those of another great conversationalist, whose
<i>Modest Proposal</i> for the eating of little children
is scarcely more cruel than <i>Mateo Falcone</i>. His
style is without felicities. It has none of the
Oriental pomp of Gautier's prose, none of the
torrential eloquence of Hugo's; but its limitations
are its virtues. Pomp is the ruin of a plain fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>as of a plain man, and rhetoric rolls facts along
too fast to do anything but smooth them. This
style, that seems to disclaim any pretension to be
a style at all, leaves facts unencumbered, with
their corners unpolished. It emphasises M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's
continual suggestion that he is not a story-teller,
and so helps to betray us into his power. But I
cannot understand those critics who find it a style
of clear glass that shows us facts through no
personality whatever. Always, in reading a
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, I have an impression of listening to a
man who has seen the world, and was young
once upon a time, who loves Brant&ocirc;me, and who
in another century would have been a friend of
Anthony Hamilton, and perhaps have written or
had a minor part in memoirs like those of the
Count Grammont. And this man is the imaginary
mouthpiece of English anecdote, the mask handed
from speaker to speaker at an English dinner-table.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's
<i>anglomanie</i>.</div>

<p>M&eacute;rim&eacute;e himself had something of the appearance
of an Englishman; everything except the
smile, according to Taine. No Frenchman can
write of him without referring to his <i>anglomanie</i>.
His mother had English relatives, and Hazlitt,
Holcroft, and Hazlitt's worshipped Northcote
were among his father's friends. He was not
baptized in the Catholic religion. He seems to
have grown up in an atmosphere not unlike that
of many English intellectual families, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
early made friends across the Channel for himself.
This Englishness perhaps partly accounts for the
peculiar attitude he took as a story-teller, and
also made possible that curious reconciliation
between the virtues of rival schools that the
attitude demanded; made possible, that is to say,
the apparent paradox of a man whose subjects
were Romantic, whose style was almost Classical,
and whose stories were yet a prophecy of the
Realists. It is not a French characteristic to
recognise virtues in more than one type at once,
and to combine them. 'Le Roi est mort; vive
le Roi.' The French invented that saying. They
do not recognise compromises, but are exclusive
in their judgments, and regulate their opinions by
general rules. A Romantic hates all Classicists,
a Realist finds his worst term of opprobrium
in the word Romantic. An Englishman, on
the other hand, does not think of regulating
his affections or actions by a theory. If he
has principles, he locks them up with his
black clothes for use on special occasions. He
keeps a sturdy affection for Oliver Cromwell,
without letting his love for the Commonwealth
abate in the least his loyalty to the King.
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e seems extraordinarily English in being
able to own Romantic ideals, without using
Romantic method.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The contrast
between his
manner and
his material.</div>

<p>The conversational story-telling depends for its
success, not on the wit or charm of the talker, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
on the plots of his stories. No more exigent test
of the intrinsic power of a tale can be applied than
this, of telling it badly in conversation. A good
story will sometimes gain by the naked recital of
its facts; a bad one is immediately betrayed.
Bad stories, in this sense, are those that resemble
the women of whom Lyly wrote:&mdash;'Take from
them their periwigges, their paintings, their
Jewells, their rowles, their boulstrings, and thou
shalt soone perceive that a woman is the least
part of hir selfe.' How many times, in repeating
to a friend the story of a book, you have become
suddenly aware it was an empty, worthless thing
that, in clothes more gorgeous than it had a right
to wear, had made you its dupe for a moment.
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e was compelled by his method to tell
good stories or none. His material, to be
sufficiently strong to stand without support, to
be built with rigid economy, and to make its
effects out of its construction, to be told as if with
a desire of making no impression, and to make
an impression all the stronger for such telling,
could not be of a light or delicate nature. His
events had to be striking, visible, conclusive. He
had to choose stories in which something happened.
There is death in almost every one of his tales.
Hence comes the amazing contrast between his
work and that of the Romantics. The large
gesture, the simple violent passions are his as well
as theirs, because he needed them, but, while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
matched their subjects in their temperaments,
and wrote of hot blood with pulsing veins, everything
in M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's stories is vivid and passionate
except the author. The atmosphere of his tales
is not warm or moist, but extraordinarily rarified.
In that clear air his colours seem almost white.
If they were not so brilliant we should not perceive
them at all. Even his women are chosen
for the attitude. The women a man loves are
usually reflected in his work. But M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's
women are the women of Romance, dying for
love or for hate, ready at any moment to throw
their emotions into dramatic action, while the
women he loved were capricious, whimsical,
tender seldom, <i>outr&eacute;es</i> never. The writer needed
picturesque women as clear as facts. The man
loved women who never betrayed themselves, but
were sufficiently elusive to give him an Epicurean
pleasure in pursuing them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An art of
construction.</div>

<p>The art of M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's tales is one of expository
construction. He was compelled by his self-denials
to be as conscious an artist as Poe. He
is like a good chess-player who surrenders many
pieces, and is forced to make most wonderful play
with the few that remain. His effects are got
from the material of his tales, not superimposed
on the vital stuff like the front of a Venetian
palace on the plain wall. He takes his dramatic
material, and sets it before us in his undecorated
style, so that no morsel of its vitality is wasted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
smothering no wild gesture in elaborate drapery,
but cutting it out so nakedly that every quivering
sinew can be seen. His art has been compared to
drawing, but it is more like sculpture. His
stories are so cleanly carved out of existence that
they are 'without deception.' We can examine
them from above and from below, in a dozen
different lights. There is no point of view from
which the artist begs us to refrain. Behind a
drawing there is a bare sheet. Behind a story of
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's there is the other side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pointillism
in facts.</div>

<p>His art is more like painting in those few tales
of the marvellous that are his ghost stories, as the
others are his anecdotes. M&eacute;rim&eacute;e had the arch&aelig;ologist's
hatred of the mysterious, and the artist's
delight in creating it. He reconciled the two by
producing mysterious effects by statements of the
utmost clarity, the very clarity of the statements
throwing the reader off his guard so that he does
not perceive the purposeful skill with which they
are chosen and put together. There is a school of
painting in France, whose followers call themselves
Pointillists; they get their effects by laying spots
of simple colours side by side, each one separate,
each one though in the right position with regard
to other spots of other colours placed in its neighbourhood.
At a sufficient distance they merge
luminously into the less simple colours of the
picture. M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's treatment of the marvellous
was not unlike this. The vague mystery of <i>La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
V&eacute;nus d'Ille</i> is not reflected by any vagueness or
mystery in the telling of the tale. It is impossible
to point to the single sentence, the single paragraph
that makes the mystery mysterious. You
cannot find them because they do not exist. Instead,
there are a hundred morsels of fact. Not
one of them is incredible; not one is without a
reasonable explanation if an explanation is necessary.
And yet all these concrete, simple facts
combine imperceptibly in producing the extraordinary
supernatural feeling of the tale. Compare
this negative manner of treating a miracle
with the frank, positive fairy-tale of Gautier's
<i>Arria Marcella</i>. The effects of both tales are
perfectly achieved, but Arria Marcella belongs to
written story-telling. We believe in her because
Gautier wishes us to believe, and uses every means
of colour and rhythm and sensual suggestion to
compel his readers to subject their imaginations
to his own. The Venus belongs to story-telling
by word of mouth. Hers is a ghost story whose
shudder we covet, and experience, in spite of ourselves,
in spite of the half-incredulous story-teller,
by virtue of those simple facts so cunningly put
together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strength
or charm.</div>

<p>But to write analytically of such stories is to
write with compass and rule, dully, awkwardly,
technically, badly. It is impossible to express the
excellence of a bridge except by showing how
perfectly its curves represent the principles of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
design, and to talk like an architect of the method
of its building. And that is so very inadequate.
It is easy to write of warmth, of delicacy, of
sweetness; there is nothing harder in the world
than to write of the icy strength that is shown not
in action but in construction. And although
there is a real charm about the shy, active, intellectual
man who made them, a charm that is
shown in his love-letters, yet there is no charm
at all about M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's stories. The difference
between them and such tales as Nathaniel Hawthorne's
is that between the little Grecian lady in
baked clay, who stands upon my mantelpiece,
still removing with what grace of curved body
and neck and delicate arm the thorn that pricked
her tiny foot some thousand years ago, and the
copy of an Egyptian god, standing upright, one
straight leg advanced, his jackal head set square
upon his shoulders, his arms stiff at his sides, his
legs like pillars, so strong in the restraint of every
line that to look at him is a bracing of the
muscles. There is no charm in him, no grace, no
delicacy, and he needs neither delicacy, grace, nor
charm. Erect in his own economy of strength he
has an implacable, strenuous power that any
added tenderness would weaken and perhaps
destroy.</p>

<h2>FLAUBERT</h2>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<h3>FLAUBERT</h3>

<p class="noin">'<span class="smcap">I am</span> the last of the fathers of the church,' said
Flaubert, and on this text his niece remarks that
'with his long chestnut coat, and little black silk
skull-cap, he had something the air of one of the
Port-Royal solitaries.' The metaphor is accurately
chosen. Flaubert lived in an atmosphere
of monastic devotion to his art, and the solitaries
of Port-Royal were not more constant than
he to their intellectual preoccupations. A man of
excessive openness to sensation, he fled it and
was fascinated by it. He would take ever so
little of the world and torture himself with its
examination because it hurt him to look at it.
Life, and especially that life whose sensitiveness
was so slight as, in comparison with his own, to
have no existence, brought him continual pain.
'La b&ecirc;tise entre mes pores.' Stupidity touching
him anywhere made him shrink like a snail
touched with a feather. He had <i>recoquillements</i>,
shrinkings up, when with his dearest friends, and
it was pain to him to be recalled to ordinary
existence. He escaped from modernity in dreams
of the Orient, but was continually drawn back by
memory of the unhappiness that was waiting for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
him, to the contemplation of those ordinary people
whose slightest act, as he imagined it, struck such
a grating discord with himself. An exuberant
life like Gautier's was impossible to such a man.
He could not be so gregarious a recluse as Balzac.
He had to fashion a peculiar retreat, a room with
two windows, from one of which he could see the
stars, and from the other watch and listen to the
people whom he hated and found so efficient as
the instruments of his self torture. He found the
seclusion he desired in a most absolute devotion
to the art of literature, which was in his hands
the art of making beauty out of pain. Pain, self-inflicted,
was at the starting-point of all his works,
and in most of them went with him step by step
throughout.</p>

<div class="caption">GUSTAVE FLAUBERT</div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Flaubert
and the
bourgeois.</div>

<p>An analysis of the pain that Flaubert suffered
in examining Philistines, that white light of
suffering which throws up so clearly the bourgeois
figures on which he let it play, supplies the key
not only to the matter of much of his work, but
to its manner, and particularly to that wonderful
prose of his, whose scrupulosity has been and is
so frequently misunderstood. Flaubert was not
pained by a bourgeois because he felt differently
from himself. He was pained by a bourgeois
because a bourgeois did not know that he felt
differently from himself, because a bourgeois
never knew how he felt at all. Whole wolves
hate a lame one. It has never been stated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>what inveterate hatred a lame one regards whole
wolves. And Flaubert was less fitted for life
than an ordinary man. He was given to know
when he was honest or dishonest to himself. In
so far was he, on their own ground, weaker than
those others, who never know whether they tell
the truth or a lie. He was born as it were with
no skin over his heart. He had no need to make
guesses at his feelings. What more terrible
nightmare could be imagined for such a man
than to hear men and women, educated, as the
bourgeois are, into a horrible facility of speech,
using the language of knowledge and emotion,
unchecked by any doubts as to their possible
inaccuracy. In all bourgeois life, where language
and action have larger scales than are necessary,
there is a discrepancy between expression and the
thing for which expression is sought. For
Flaubert, sensitive to this discrepancy as the
ordinary man is not, it was a perpetual pain.
And just as a man who has a nerve exposed in
one of his teeth, touches it again and again, in
spite of himself, for the exquisite twinge that
reminds him it is there, so Flaubert in more than
one half of his books is occupied in hurting himself
by the delicate and infinitely varied search for
this particular discord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flaubert's
prose.</div>

<p>Flaubert's prose is due, like his unhappiness, to
his inhuman trueness of feeling. He realised that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
flexible as language is, there are almost insuperable
difficulties in the way of any one who wishes
to put an idea accurately into words. He went
to the bottom of all writing and announced that
literature is founded on the word; and that unless
you have the right word you have the wrong
literature. He was a little puzzled at the survival
of the mighty improvisations of older times,
although he loved them; but there was no doubt
in his mind that his own way was not 'a primrose
path to the everlasting bonfire' of bad books.
Whatever he wrote, he would have it in words
chosen one by one, scrupulously matched in scent,
colour, and atmosphere to the ideas or emotions he
wished to express. His whole creed was to tell
the truth. What exactly did he feel? These
were the letters that were always flaming before
him. It is vivid discomfort to a labourer to be
cross-questioned, and forced to find words for his
unrealised meanings. With increased facility of
speech we grow callous, and, compromising with
our words, write approximations to the thoughts
that, not having accurately described, we can
scarcely be said to possess. Flaubert, in disgust at
such inexactitudes, forced on his own highly educated
brain the discomfort of the cross-questioned
labourer. Knowing the truth, he would say it
or nothing, and rejected phrase after phrase in his
search for precision. It was gain and loss to
him; gain in texture, loss in scope. 'What a
scope Balzac had,' he cried, and then: 'What a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
writer he would have been if only he had been
able to write.' The work of such men is loosely
knit in comparison with his, because built in a
less resisting material. 'Oui,' says Gautier&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">'Oui, l'œuvre sort plus belle</div>
<div class="i0">D'une forme au travail</div>
<div class="i2">Rebelle,</div>
<div class="i0">Vers, marbre, onyx, &eacute;mail.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noin">Flaubert's attitude made prose a medium as hard,
as challenging as these.</p>

<p>It is difficult to believe that the older writers
bought their excellence so dearly. Their thoughts
cannot have been so biassed, for it is the expression
of every bias, of the background, of the smell, of
the feel of an idea that makes circumspicuity of
writing so difficult. Montaigne, for example,
sitting peaceably in his tower, asking himself
with lively interest what were his opinions, was
not at all like the almost terrible figure of Flaubert,
striding to and fro in his chamber, wringing
phrases from his nerves, asking passionately,
ferociously, what he meant, and almost throttling
himself for an accurate answer. Is it harder than
it was to produce a masterpiece?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Romanticism
and
realism.</div>

<p>Flaubert, who held Chateaubriand a master,
was the friend of Gautier, and the director in his
art of Guy de Maupassant, who wrote with one
hand <i>Madame Bovary</i> and with the other <i>Salammbo</i>,
who put in the same book <i>St. Julien l'Hospitalier</i>
and <i>Un Cœur Simple</i>, is, on a far grander scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
than M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, an illustration as well as a reason
of the development of romanticism into realism.
Flaubert's passionate care for the truth, would, if
he had lived before the Romantic movement, have
confined itself to the elaboration of a very scrupulous
prose. But after the discovery of local
colour, after the surprising discovery of the variety
that exists in things, as great as the variety that
exists in words and in their combinations, it was
sure to apply itself not only to the writing but
also to those external things that had suggested
the ideas the writing was to embody. It would
try to make the sentences true to their author; it
would also try to make them true to the life they
were to represent. It was Flaubert who said to
De Maupassant as they passed a cabstand, 'Young
man, describe that horse in one sentence so as to
distinguish him from every other horse in the
world, and I shall begin to believe that you have
possibilities as a writer.' This demand for accurate
portraiture turned the romantic realism of Balzac's
<i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i> into the other realism of
<i>Madame Bovary</i>. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span><i>Madame
Bovary.</i><span class="hidev">|</span></span>Balzac had his models, yes,
as hints in the back of his head, but he made his
characters alive with his own energy and his own
brain. As I have already pointed out, they are
all too alive to be true. But Flaubert, true to
himself in his manner, wished to be true to life in
his matter. Madame Bovary, that second-rate,
ordinary, foolish, weak, little provincial wife, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
no atmosphere about her but her own. She has
not been inoculated with the blood of Flaubert, as
all the veins of all the characters of Balzac have
been scorched with fire from those of that 'joyful
wild boar.' When Flaubert wrote that everything
in the book was outside himself, he was
saying no more than the truth. He was as honest
towards her and her life as he was towards his
own ideas. She talks like herself. Now the older
writers, like Fielding and Smollett, are content to
let their people talk as men and women should
talk to be fit for good literature. Even the
characters of men like Balzac or Hugo say what
they think, as nearly as their creators are themselves
able to express it. Flaubert is infinitely
more scrupulous. The Bovary never says what
she thinks. Flaubert knew well enough what she
was thinking, but sought out exactly those phrases
and sentences beneath which she would have
hidden her thought, those horrible bourgeois
inaccuracies that it was torture for him to hear.</p>

<p>A life so wholly concerned with intangible
things seems too intellectual for humanity. I
am glad to turn aside from it for a moment to
remember the Flaubert who was loved by those
who spent their days with him; the uncle who
taught her letters to his little niece, and who
would, as she says, have done anything imaginable
to enliven her when sad or ill. 'One of his
greatest pleasures was the amusement of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
about him,' although he never saw a woman
without thinking of her skeleton, a child without
remembering that it would one day be old, or
a cradle without finding in it the promise of a
grave. He was one of the men who love their
friends the dearer for their dislike of mankind in
general. He never shaved without laughing at
'the intrinsic absurdity of human life,' and yet
he lived out his own share in it with steadfast
purpose, 'yoking himself to his work like an ox
to the plough.'</p>

<p>The result of his incessant labour divides itself
into four kinds; novels of the bourgeoisie, a novel
of the East, three short stories, and two other
books that are, as it were, twin keys to the whole.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Salammbo.</i></div>

<p><i>Madame Bovary</i> and <i>L'&Eacute;ducation Sentimentale</i>
are the novels of the bourgeoisie, novels with an
entirely new quality of vision, due to the sustained
contrast between his own articulate habit of
mind and the unconsciously inarticulate minds
of his characters; these are the books commonly
described as his contributions to Realism by
men too ready to set him on their own level.
Opposed to these two books there is <i>Salammbo</i>,
an Oriental and ancient romance, a reposeful
dream for him, in which move characters whose
feelings and expressions are no more blurred than
his own. All these books offer more delight at
each re-reading, although the last, considered as
an example of narrative, is almost a failure. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Romantics too often miss the trees for the wood.
Flaubert's method makes it rather easy to miss
the wood for the trees. But his trees are of such
interest and beauty that we are ready to examine
them singly. In writing <i>Madame Bovary</i>, his
subject was close within his reach. Madame was
too near to allow him to cover her up with a
library of knowledge about his own times. But
in <i>Salammbo</i> he was so anxious to be true to the
life that he did not know, that he read until he
knew too much. The book is made of perfect
sentences, perfect descriptions, while the story
itself is buried beneath a dust-heap of antiquity.
Cartloads after cartloads of gorgeous things are
emptied on the top of each other, until the
whole is a glittering mass with here and there
some splendid detail shining so brilliantly among
the rest that we would like to remove it for a
museum. The mass stirs: there are movements
within it; but they are too heavily laden to shake
themselves free and become visible and intelligible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Trois Contes.</i></div>

<p>No such criticism can be urged against the
three short stories, the <i>Trois Contes</i>, in which
Flaubert proves himself not only one of the
greatest writers of all time, but also one of the
greatest story-tellers. This little book is a fit
pendant to the novels, since it represents both the
Flaubert of <i>Madame Bovary</i> and the Flaubert of
<i>Salammbo</i>. <i>Un Cœur Simple</i>, the first of the three,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
is the story of a servant woman and her parrot, a
subject that de Maupassant might have chosen.
So completely is it weaned from himself, that no
one would suspect that Flaubert wrote it after his
mother's death, for the pleasure, in describing the
provincial household, of remembering his own
childhood. It and the two stories, <i>St. Julien
l'Hospitalier</i> and <i>H&eacute;rodias</i>, which are purely
romantic in subject and treatment, and more
scrupulous in technique than the finest of Gautier,
are among the most beautiful tales that the nineteenth
century produced. All three answer the
supreme test of a dozen readings as admirably as
those old improvisations from whose spirit they
are so utterly alien.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>La Tentation
de Saint
Antoine</i> and
<i>Bouvard et
P&eacute;cuchet</i>.</div>

<p>That is the sum of Flaubert's work in pure
narrative. There are beside it two books, one
a <i>Tentation de Saint Antoine</i>, that he spent his
whole life in bringing to perfection, and the other,
<i>Bouvard et P&eacute;cuchet</i>, that he left unfinished at
his death. They are among the most wonderful
philosophic books of the world. In an Oriental
dream, a dialogue form with stage directions so
explicit and descriptive as to do the work of
narrative, and in a story whose form might have
been dictated by Voltaire, whose material was
the same as that used in the novels, he expressed
man in the presence of Religion, and man in
the presence of Knowledge. The legend of St.
Anthony is treated by the Flaubert who loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the East, the story of Bouvard and P&eacute;cuchet
by the Flaubert who tortured himself with
observation of the bourgeois. St. Anthony is
tempted of love and of all the religions; at last,
not triumphing, but shaken and very weary, he
kneels again, and Flaubert leaves him. Bouvard
and P&eacute;cuchet, the two clerks given by the accident
of a legacy the aloofness and the opportunity
for development that was Anthony's,
are tempted of love and of all the knowledges;
at last made very miserable they return to their
desks; that is where Flaubert would have left
them if he had lived. To discuss the settings
of these two great expositions is to ask the
question that was asked by a disciple at the end
of Voltaire's <i>Dream of Plato</i>. 'And then, I
suppose, you awoke?' It is only permissible after
recognising the grandeur of the underlying idea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The statue
of <i>Le
Penseur</i>.</div>

<p>There have been two men with such a conception
of thought. Rodin carved what Flaubert
had written. The statue of <i>Le Penseur</i>, that
stands in front of the Panth&eacute;on in Paris, is the
statue of a man tormented like St. Anthony,
baffled like Bouvard and P&eacute;cuchet. This statue
does not represent man's dream of the power of
thought, of the dominion of thought. That head
is no clear mechanism, faultless and frictionless;
that attitude is not one of placid contemplation.
The head is in torture, the whole body grips
itself in the agony of articulation. The statue is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
not that of <i>a</i> thinker, but of <i>the</i> thinker; man
before the Universe, man unable to wrest the
words out of himself. Flaubert had such a vision
as that when he wrote the <i>Tentation</i> and <i>Bouvard
et P&eacute;cuchet</i>. He hated mankind because they
could not share it with him. They did not know
as he knew, or see as he saw, but knelt or worked,
and were happy. This one stupendous conception
of the true relation between man and
thought is that on which all Flaubert's work is
founded. Expressed in these two books, it is
implied in all the others (even in <i>Salammbo</i>, which
is almost an attempt to escape from it). It is not
a message; it does not say anything; it is as
dumb as Rodin's statue; it simply <i>is</i>&mdash;like
<i>Paradise Lost</i> or the <i>Mona Lisa</i> or a religion.

<p>'The author in his work ought to be like God in the
Universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere.</p>

<p>'Fine subjects make mediocre works.'</p>

<p>These sentences might well be taken as de Maupassant's
inspiration. De Maupassant, a man of powerful mind, with
Flaubert's example before him, makes each of his tales a
rounded unity, and a thing outside himself, and yet a thing
that no one else could have written. He shunned fine
subjects. His stories are like sections of life prepared for
examination, and in looking at them we are flattered into
thinking that we have clearer eyes than usual. He chooses
some quite ordinary incident, and by working up selected
details of it, turns it into a story as exciting to the curiosity
as a detective puzzle. He allows no abstract feminine-phrased
discourses on the psychology of his characters: he
does not take advantage of their confessions. Their psychology
is manifested in things said and in things done. The
works, as in life, are hidden in the fourth dimension, where
we cannot see them.</p>

<p><i>La Rendezvous</i>, a tiny story of seven pages, will illustrate
his methods. The chosen incident is that of a woman going
to see her lover, meeting some one else on the way, and going
off with him instead. That is all. Let us see how de
Maupassant works it out. Here is his first paragraph:</p>

<p>'Her hat on her head, her cloak on her back, a black veil
across her face, another in her pocket, which she would put
on over the first as soon as she was in the guilty cab, she
was tapping the point of her boot with the end of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
umbrella, and stayed sitting in her room, unable to make
up her mind to go out to keep the appointment.'</p>

<p>The whole of her indecision is expressed before it is
explained. Then there is a paragraph that lets us know
that she had been keeping the appointment regularly for two
years, and we sympathise with her a little. A description
of her room follows, made by mention of a clock ticking the
seconds, a half-read book on a rosewood desk, and a perfume.
The clock strikes and she goes out, lying to the servant.
We watch her, loitering on the way, telling herself that the
Vicomte awaiting her would be opening the window, listening
at the door, sitting down, getting up, and, since she had
forbidden him to smoke on the days of her visits, throwing
desperate glances at the cigarette-box. De Maupassant's
characters think in pictures of physical action. People do so
in real life.</p>

<p>The heroine sits in a square watching children, and
reflects, always in the concrete, how much the Vicomte is
going to bore her, and on the terrible danger of rendezvous,
and so on, making pictures all the time. At last, when she
is three-quarters of an hour late, she gets up and sets out
for his rooms. She has not gone ten steps before she meets
a diplomatic baron, of whose character in her eyes de
Maupassant has been careful to let us have a hint beforehand.
He asks her, after the usual politenesses, to come
and see his Japanese collections. He is an adroit person
this baron. He does not make love to her. He laughs at
her. He ends, after a delightful little dialogue, in half
hurrying, half frightening her into a cab. They have
scarcely started when she cries out that she has forgotten
that she had promised her husband to invite the Vicomte to
dinner. They stop at a post office. The baron goes in and
gets her a telegram card. She writes on it in pencil&mdash;it
would be vandalism to spoil the message by translating it
from the French&mdash;she writes:</p>

<p>'Mon cher ami, je suis tr&egrave;s souffrante; j'ai une n&eacute;vralgie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>atroce qui me tient au lit. Impossible sortir. Venez
diner demain soir pour que je me fasse pardonner.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jeanne.</span>'
</p>

<p>She licks the edge, closes it carefully, writes the Vicomte's
address, and then, handing it to the baron, 'Now, will you
be so good as to drop this in the box for telegrams.'</p>

<p>There de Maupassant ends, without comment of any kind.
His stories have always 'the look of a gentleman,' and know
how to move, when to stop, what to put in and what to
leave out. They are impersonal, but not more impersonal
than M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's. There is a man behind them, and in
contradistinction to the school of writers with whom he has
been confounded, he does not blink the fact, but obeys
Flaubert's maxim, allowing his presence to be felt but keeping
himself invisible. De Maupassant, the pupil of Flaubert,
makes even clearer than his master the intimate connection
between those apparently hostile things, Romanticism and
Realism. Lesser and coarser minds may have needed the
stimulus of a revolt when none was; but the great men on
the heights knew that the suns of dawn and sunset were
the same.</p>

<p>De Maupassant's position in this book is commensurate
neither with his genius nor with what I should like to say
of him, and hope to write in another place. I had wished
my book to end with the Romantic Movement, and so with
Flaubert, who seems to me to mark its ultimate development
without a change of name. De Maupassant is here
only to show how direct is the descent of the least exuberant
of modern story-telling from the Romanticism that made
possible the work of Chateaubriand, Hugo, or Balzac. His
true position is in a book that should begin with Flaubert
and end with some great writer of to-morrow, whose work
should show by what alchemy the story-telling of to-day
will be changed into that of the future.</p></blockquote>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">My</span> table is covered with a green cloth, and on it,
under the lamplight, are two bowls of roses. One
is full of the rich garden flowers, whose hundred
folded petals hold in their depths the shadows of
their colourings&mdash;cream, crimson, and the rose and
orange of an autumn sunset. In the other are
three or four wild roses from the hedge on the
far side of the lane. I scarcely know which give
me greater pleasure. In comparing them I seem
to be setting <i>Aucassin and Nicolete</i> by the side of
<i>La Morte Amoureuse</i>. How many flowers must
represent the gradual growth of one into the
other. How large a collection would be necessary
to illustrate every stage of the transformation of
the simple beauty of the wild blossoms into the
luxuriant loveliness, majesty, and variety of the
roses in the opposite bowl. I have attempted
such a task in this book; not the impossible one
of collecting every flower in any way different
from those that had opened before it, but of
bringing together a score or so to make the
difference between first and last a little less tantalising
and obscure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Genius a
stationary
quality.</div>

<p>I had thought I was tracing a progress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
art itself; but I no longer think so. Century
after century has laid its gift before the story-teller,
its gift of a form, an unworked vein, a point of
view. He has learnt to hold us with an episode,
and also, evening after evening, to keep us interested
in the lives of a dozen different people
whose adventures in the pages of a book he makes
no less actual than our own. In this last century
of the art we have seen men looking back to all
the ages before them, and bringing into modern
story-telling the finest qualities of the most ancient,
recreating it, and winning for it the universal
acknowledgment that is given to painting, poetry,
or music. Much seems to have been done, and
yet, who would dare assign to a modern story-teller,
however excellent a craftsman, a place
above Boccaccio? Who says that his digressions
make old Dan Chaucer out of date? Art does not
progress but in consciousness of its technique and
in breadth of power. Genius is a stationary
quality. Techniques and the conditions of production,
qualified the one by the other, and
modified by genius, move past it side by side, like
an endless procession before a seated king. The
works they carry between them are not to be
judged by their place in the cavalcade, but by the
spirit before whom they pass, who wakes from
time to time to give them life and meaning.</p>

<p>None the less, there is a kind of imperfect
contemporariness in the art that lets the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
works of all times remain side by side to be imitated
or compared. And this power of survival
that belongs to works of genius accounts for two
phenomena, which give genius itself a spurious air
of progress. The one is an ever clearer consciousness
of technique, the other an ever wider
range of possibilities, both due to the increasing
number of works of art that are ready for comparison
or imitation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dissociation of forms.</div>

<p>In the latter half of my book, and particularly
in the chapters on Poe, M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, Hawthorne, and
Flaubert, we have been partly busied in remarking
the later stages of self-conscious craftsmanship.
There remains to be discussed the dissociation of
one form from another that naturally accompanied
this more observant technique. I want to distinguish
here between the short story, the <i>nouvelle</i>,
and the novel, which are not short, middle-sized,
and lengthy specimens of the same thing, but
forms whose beauties are individual and distinct.
They demand quite different skills, and few men
have excelled in more than one of them. Before
proceeding to closer definition, let me name an
example of each, to keep in our minds for purposes
of reference while considering their several moulds.
Balzac's <i>P&egrave;re Goriot</i> is a novel; Gautier's <i>La
Morte Amoureuse</i> is a <i>nouvelle</i>; de Maupassant's
<i>La Petite Ficelle</i> is a short story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The novel.</div>

<p>The novel was the first form to be used by men
with a clear knowledge of what it allowed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to do, and what it expected of them in return.
Smollett's is its simplest definition. 'A novel,'
he says, 'is a large diffused picture, comprehending
the characters of life, disposed in different
groups and exhibited in various attitudes, for the
purpose of a uniform plan and general occurrence,
to which every individual figure is subservient.'
It is, as near as may be, a piece of life, and one of its
similarities to ordinary existence is perhaps the
characteristic that best marks its difference from
the <i>nouvelle</i>. The novel contains at least one
counterplot, the <i>nouvelle</i> none. Life has as many
counterplots as it has actors, as many heroes and
heroines as play any part in it at all. No man is
a hero to his valet, because in that particular plot
the valet happens to be a hero to himself. The
novelist does not attempt so equable a characterisation,
but by telling the adventures of more than
one group of people, and by threading their tales
in and out through each other, he contrives to give
a conventional semblance of the intricate story-telling
of life.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
<i>nouvelle</i>.</div>

<p>The <i>nouvelle</i> is a novel without a counterplot,
and on a smaller scale.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The latter quality is
dependent on the former, since it combats the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>difficulty of sustained attention, that the novel
avoids by continual change from one to another
of its parallel stories. The <i>nouvelle</i> was with
Boccaccio little more than a plot made actual by
the more important sentences of dialogue, and by
concise sketching of its principal scenes. It has now
grown to be a most delicate and delightful form,
without breathlessness and without compression, its
aim of pure story being implicit in the manner of its
telling. It is differentiated from the short story,
the advantage of whose brevity it shares in a lesser
degree, by the separate importance of its scenes,
which are not bound to be subjected so absolutely
to its conclusion. For example, the splendid
cathedral scene in <i>La Morte Amoureuse</i>, where, at
the moment of ordination, a young priest is
stricken with passion for a courtesan, would be
unjustifiable in a short story unless it ended in the
climax of the tale. The priest would have to die
on the steps of the altar, or the woman to kill herself
at his feet as he passed, a vowed celebate,
down the cathedral aisle. The short story must
be a single melody ending with itself; the <i>nouvelle</i>
a piece of music, the motive of whose opening
bars, recurring again and again throughout, is
finally repeated with the increase in meaning that
is given it by the whole performance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The short
story.</div>

<p>The short story proper is in narrative prose what
the short lyric is in poetry. It is an episode, an
event, a scene, a sentence, whose importance is such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
that it allows nothing in the story that is not
directly concerned with its realisation. This is
true of many specimens of the <i>nouvelle</i>, but it is
the essential rule of the short story. Look at the
end of <i>La Petite Ficelle</i>, or of any other of the
<i>Contes</i> of de Maupassant. 'Une 'tite ficelle ...
une 'tite ficelle ... t'nez la, voila, m'sieu le Maire.'
'A little bit of string ... a little bit of string ...
look, there it is, M. le Maire.' That sentence,
repeated by the dying man in his delirium, needs
for the full pathos of its effect every word of the
story. From the first paragraph about an ordinary
market day, the accident of the old man picking
up a piece of string in a place where a purse had
been lost, the false accusation, and his guilt-seeming
protestation of innocence, every detail in the
story is worked just so far as to make the reader's
mind as ready and sensitive as possible for the final
infliction of those few words. Keats once coated
the inside of his mouth with cayenne pepper to
feel as keenly as he could 'the delicious coolness
of claret.' The art of the short story is just such
a making ready for such a momentary sensation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The possibilities
of
narrative.</div>

<p>Just as Time, with the clearer consciousness of
technique, has made the moulds of the art more
markedly distinct, so it has given the artist an
infinite choice of amalgams with which to fill them.
Although some of the most delightful examples
of narrative are still produced with the old and
worthy object of telling a tale to pass the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
although there are still men who lay their mats
upon the ground, squat down on them, and keep
their audiences happy by stories that demand no
more intellectual attention than the buzz of bees
in the magnolia flowers; yet, if we consider only
those artists who have been discussed in the preceding
chapters, we perceive at once how many are
the other possibilities of narrative, and, if we examine
the story-telling of our own day, we shall
find that most of them are illustrated in contemporary
practice.</p>

<p>Story-telling has grown into a means of expression
with a gamut as wide as that of poetry, which
is as wide as that of humanity. 'It is literature,'
says Wilde, 'that shows us the body in its swiftness
and the soul in its unrest'; and the same art
that helps us to laze away a summer afternoon is
a key that lets us into the hearts of men we have
never seen, and not infrequently opens our own
to us, when, in the bustle of existence, we have gone
out and found ourselves unable to return. It is a
Gyges' ring with which, upon our finger, we can go
about the world and mingle in the business of men
to whom we would not bow, or who would not
bow to us. It breaks the gold or iron collars of
our classes and sets each man free as a man to
understand all other men soever. It opens our
eyes like Shelley's to see that life&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">'like a dome of many-coloured glass,</div>
<div class="i0">Stains the white radiance of eternity.'</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
We become conscious of that radiance when, by
this art made free of time, we can dream the dreams
of the Pharaohs, pray with the hermits in the
Thebaid, and send our hazardous guesses like seeking
dogs into the dim forests of futurity. Our eyes
may fitly shine, and we become as little children
in brief resting-hours out of the grown-up world,
when this art makes those tints ours that we never
knew, and sends us, divested of our monotones, to
choose among all the glittering colours of mankind.</p>

<p>And if we are not listeners only, but have ourselves
something to fit with wings and to send out
to find those men who will know the whispering
sound of its flight and take it to themselves, how
much do we not owe to this most manifold art of
story-telling?</p>

<p>There is nothing that its pinions will not bear.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It would be possible to trace an interesting history of narrative
in verse from Chaucer to our own day. But although the names
of Spenser, Milton, Lafontaine, Gay, Goldsmith, Keats, Coleridge,
Wordsworth, Tennyson, Rossetti, which with many others come
instantly to mind, show how various and suggestive such an essay
might be, yet the purpose of this book would hardly be served by its
inclusion. It would be more nearly concerned with the history of
poetry than with that of story-telling.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> It is worth noticing as an additional proof of the close connection
between the story in letters and the feminine novel that <i>Sense and
Sensibility</i> was built out of an older tale that she actually wrote in
epistolary form.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The distinction between novel and romance made in the chapter
on Hawthorne is one of material rather than of form. It is possible
to use the material of romance in the form of either novel, <i>nouvelle</i>,
or short story.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The novelette is not the same as the <i>nouvelle</i>, but simply a short
novel as its name implies.</p></div>
